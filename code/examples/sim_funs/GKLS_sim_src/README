This calls an executable that evaluates a synthetic objective function. The
function is a convex quadratic modified by polynomials to insert local minima
with known locations. 

1. The to-be-evaluated point is written to file.
2. The simulation is called.
3. The simulation writes the answer to file.
4. The objective function is read in from file.


First compile the executable by running 

$ make gkls_single

in this directory.

Test points:

>>> from GKLS_obj import call_GKLS
>>> call_GKLS([0,0], {'problem_dimension': 2, 'problem_number': 1, 'number_of_minima':10})
0.651893131110870327 
>>> call_GKLS([1,1], {'problem_dimension': 2, 'problem_number': 1, 'number_of_minima':10})
0.817253468540122152
