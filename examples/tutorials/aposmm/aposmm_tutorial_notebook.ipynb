    "This tutorial demonstrates libEnsemble’s capability to identify multiple minima from simulation outputs using the built-in APOSMM (Asynchronously Parallel Optimization Solver for finding Multiple Minima) generator function (`gen_f`). In this tutorial, we’ll create a simple simulation function (`sim_f`) that defines a function with multiple minima, then write a libEnsemble calling script that imports APOSMM and parameterizes it to check for minima over a domain of outputs from our `sim_f`.\n",

    "## APOSMM Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "APOSMM coordinates multiple local optimization runs starting from a collection of sample points. These local optimization runs occur concurrently, and can incorporate a variety of optimization methods, including from NLopt, PETSc/TAO, and SciPy. Some number of uniformly sampled points is returned by APOSMM for simulation evaluations before local optimization runs can occur, if no prior simulation evaluations are provided. User-requested sample points can also be provided to APOSMM:\n",
    "\n",
    "![6hcsampling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Libensemble/libensemble/main/docs/images/sampling_6hc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, APOSMM will begin local optimization runs from those points that don’t have better (more minimal) points nearby within a threshold ``r_k``. For the above example, after APOSMM has returned the uniformly sampled points, for simulation evaluations it will likely begin local optimization runs from the user-requested approximate minima. Providing these isn’t required, but can offer performance benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each local optimization run chooses new points and determines if they’re better by passing them back to be evaluated by the simulation routine. If so, new local optimization runs are started from those points. This continues until each run converges to a minimum:\n",
    "\n",
    "![6hclocalopt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Libensemble/libensemble/main/docs/images/localopt_6hc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, generated and evaluated points are appended to the History array, with the field ``'local_pt'`` being ``True`` if the point is part of a local optimization run, and ``'local_min'`` being ``True`` if the point has been ruled a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## APOSMM Persistence\n",

    "APOSMM uses a Persistent generator. A single worker process initiates APOSMM so that it “persists” and keeps running over the course of the entire libEnsemble routine.\n",
