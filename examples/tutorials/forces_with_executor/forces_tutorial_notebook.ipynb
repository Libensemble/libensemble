    "This tutorial highlights libEnsemble's capability to execute\n",
    "and monitor external scripts or user applications within simulation or generator\n",
    "functions using a libEnsemble Executor. In this tutorial,\n",
    "our calling script registers a compiled executable that simulates\n",
    "electrostatic forces between a collection of particles. The simulator function\n",
    "launches instances of this executable and reads output files to determine\n",
    "if the run was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to use ``subprocess`` calls from Python to issue\n",
    "commands such as ``jsrun`` or ``aprun`` to run applications. Unfortunately,\n",
    "hard-coding such commands within user scripts isn't portable.\n",
    "Furthermore, many systems like Argonne's Theta do not\n",
    "allow libEnsemble to submit additional tasks from the compute nodes. On these\n",
    "systems, a proxy launch mechanism (such as Balsam) is required.\n",
    "libEnsemble's Executors were developed to directly address such issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, libEnsemble's MPI Executor can automatically\n",
    "detect available MPI runners and resources, and by default divide them equally among workers.\n",
