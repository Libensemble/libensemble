"""
Simulation functions that use the MPIExecutor with dynamic resource assignment.
``six_hump_camel`` and ``helloworld`` python scripts are used as example
applications, but these could be any MPI application.

Each simulation function use the resources assigned to this worker to set CPU
count and, in some functions, specify GPU usage.

GPUs are not used for the six_hump_camel function, but these tests check the
assignment is correct. For an example that runs an actual GPU application, see
the forces_gpu tutorial under libensemble/tests/scaling_tests/forces/forces_gpu.

See CUDA_variable_resources for an example where the sim function
interrogates available resources and sets explicitly.
