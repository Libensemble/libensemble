    This allocation function gives (in order) entries in ``H`` to idle workers
    to evaluate in the simulation function. The fields in ``sim_specs["in"]``
    are given. If all entries in `H` have been given to be evaluated, a worker
    is told to call the generator function, provided this wouldn't result in
    more than ``alloc_specs["user"]["num_active_gen"]`` active generators. Also allows
    for a ``"batch_mode"``.
