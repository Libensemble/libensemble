## Running test run_libe_forces_funcx.py

Naive Electrostatics Code Test

This is designed only as an artificial, highly configurable test
code for a libEnsemble sim func. This variant is primarily to test libEnsemble's
capability to submit simulation functions to a separate machine from where libEnsemble's
manager and workers are running.

### Forces Mini-App

A system of charged particles is initialized and simulated over a number of time-steps.

See `forces_app` directory for details.

This application will need to be compiled on the remote machine where the sim_f will run.
See below.

### Running with libEnsemble.

On the remote machine, Configure the endpoint's `config.py` to include your project information and
match the machine's specifications.
See [here](https://funcx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endpoints.html#theta-alcf) for
an example ALCF Theta configuration.

Then to run with local comms (multiprocessing) with one manager and `N` workers:

    python run_libe_forces_globus_compute.py --comms local --nworkers N

To run with MPI comms using one manager and `N-1` workers:

    mpirun -np N python run_libe_forces_globus_compute.py

Application parameters can be adjusted in `globus_compute_forces.yaml`.

Note that each function and path must be accessible and/or importable on the
remote machine. Absolute paths are recommended.

To remove output before the next run:

    ./cleanup.sh
