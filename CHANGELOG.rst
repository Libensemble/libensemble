Release 0.10.0
--------------

:Date: May 26, 2023

New capabilities:

* Enhance portability and simplify the assignment of procs/GPUs to worker resources #928 / #983
 * Auto-detect GPUs across systems (inc. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel GPUs).
 * Auto-determination of GPU assignment method by MPI runner or provided platform.
 * Portable `auto_assign_gpus` / `match_procs_to_gpus` and `num_gpus` arguments added to the MPI executor submit.
 * Add `set_to_gpus` function (similar to `set_to_slots`).
 * Allow users to specify known systems via option or environment variable.
 * Allow users to specify their own system configurations.
 * These changes remove a number of tweaks that were needed for particular platforms.

*  Resource management supports GPU and non-GPU simulations in the same ensemble. #993
 * User's can specify `num_procs` and `num_gpus` in the generator for each evaluation.

* Pydantic models are used for validating major libE input (input can be provided as classes or dictionaries). #878
* Added option to store output and ensemble directories in a workflow directory. #982
* Simplify user function interface. Valid user functions can accept <4 parameters and return <3 values. #971
* New option to parse settings from **TOML**. #745
* New `dry_run` option to `libE()` that checks scripts are valid and returns. #987
* Added an option to the executor submit function to pre-execute a script in the task environment. #996

Breaking changes:

* Removed old Balsam Executor. #921
* Ensemble class moved from `libensemble.api` to `libensemble.ensemble`. #1003
* Default to one resource set per simulation in dynamic scheduling mode. #996

Documentation:

* Added type hints/annotations for major modules/functions. #823
* Added Polaris Guide. #930
* Added Frontier Guide. #909
* Added PBS example scripts. #956 #930
* Streamlined and improved the readability of docs. #1004

Tests and Examples:

* Updated forces_gpu tutorial example. #956
 * Source code edit is not required for the GPU version.
 * Reports whether running on device or host.
 * Increases problem size.
 * Added versions with persistent generator and multi-task (GPU v non-GPU).
* Moved multiple tests, generators, and simulators to the community repo.
* Added ytopt example. And updated heFFTe example. #943
* Support Python 3.11 #922

:Note:

* Tested platforms include Linux, MacOS, Windows and major systems: Frontier (OLCF), Polaris (ALCF), and Perlmutter (NERSC). The major system tests ran heterogeneous workflows.
* Recent testing was also carried out on Summit (IBM Power9/LSF), but this was not possible at time of release.
* Tested Python versions: (Cpython) 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11.

:Known issues:

* See known issues section in the documentation.

Release 0.9.3
-------------

:Date: October 13, 2022

New capabilities:

* New pair of utilities, `liberegister` and `libesubmit` (based on *PSI/J*), for easily preparing and launching libEnsemble workflows with local comms onto most machines and schedulers. #807
* New persistent support function to cancel sim_ids (`request_cancel_sim_ids`). #880
* `keep_state` option for persistent workers: this lets the manager know that the information being sent is intermediate. #880

Other enhancements:

* The Executor `manager_poll()` interface now sets consistent flags instead of literal strings. #877
* Some internal modules and the test suite now work on Windows. #869 #888
* Specifying the `num_resource_sets` *libE_specs* option instead of `zero_resource_workers` is now recommended except when using a fixed worker/resource mapping. Use ``persis_info["gen_resources"]`` to assign persistent generator resources (default is zero). #905
* An extraneous warning removed. #903

:Note:

* Tested platforms include Linux, MacOS, Windows, Theta (Cray XC40/Cobalt), Summit (IBM Power9/LSF), Bebop (Cray CS400/Slurm), Swing (A100 GPU system), Perlmutter (HPE Cray EX with A100 NVIDIA GPUs). For Perlmutter, see "Known issues" below.
* Tested Python versions: (Cpython) 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.

:Known issues:

* At time of testing on Perlmutter there was an issue running concurrent applications on a node, following a recent system update. This also affects previous versions of libEnsemble, and is being investigated.
* See known issues section in the documentation.

Release 0.9.2
-------------

:Date: July 06, 2022

New capabilities:

* Support auto-detection of PBS node lists. #602
* Added configuration options for `libE_stats.txt` file. #743
* Support for `spawn` and `forkserver` multiprocessing start methods. #797

 * Note that macOS no longer switches to using `fork`. macOS (since Python 3.8) and Windows default to
   using `spawn`. When using `spawn`, we recommend placing calling script code in an ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` block.
   The multiprocessing interface can be used to switch methods (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.set_start_method).

Updates to example functions:

Added simple dynamic sampling example. #833
Added heFFTe example. #844
Regression tests separated into problem examples and functionality tests. #839

:Note:

* Tested platforms include Linux, MacOS, Theta (Cray XC40/Cobalt), Summit (IBM Power9/LSF), Bebop (Cray CS400/Slurm), Swing (A100 GPU system), Perlmutter (HPE Cray EX with A100 NVIDIA GPUs).
* Tested Python versions: (Cpython) 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.

:Known issues:

* The APOSMM generator function has been noted to operate slower than expected with the `spawn` multiprocessing start method. For this reason we recommend using `fork` with APOSMM, when using `local` comms (`fork` is the default method on Linux systems).
* See known issues section in the documentation.

Release 0.9.1
-------------

This release has minimal changes, but a large number of touched lines.

* Reformatted code for **black** compliance, including string normalization. #811, #814, #821
* Added Spock and Crusher guides. #802
* User can now set ``calc_status`` to any string (for output in libE_stats). #808
* Added a workflows community initiative file. #817

:Note:

* Tested platforms include Linux, MacOS, Theta (Cray XC40/Cobalt), Summit (IBM Power9/LSF), Bebop (Cray CS400/Slurm), Swing (A100 GPU system), Perlmutter (HPE Cray EX with A100 NVIDIA GPUs).
* Tested Python versions: (Cpython) 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.

:Known issues:

* See known issues section in the documentation.

Release 0.5.0
-------------

:Date: May 22, 2019

* Added local (multiprocessing) and TCP options for manager/worker communications, in addition to mpi4py. (#42).

 * Example: libEnsemble can be run on MOM/launch nodes (e.g., those of ALCF/Theta & OLCF/Summit) and can remotely detect compute resources.
 * Example: libEnsemble can be run on a system without MPI.
 * Example: libEnsemble can be run with a local manager and remote TCP workers.

* Added support for Summit/LSF scheduler in job controller.
* MPI job controller detects and retries launches on failure; adding resilience. (#143)
* Job controller supports option to extract/print job times in libE_stats.txt. (#136)
* Default logging level changed to INFO. (#164)
* Logging interface added, which allows user to change logging level and file. (#110)
* All worker logging and calculation stats are routed through manager.
* libEnsemble can be run without a gen_func, for example, when using a previously computed random sample. (#122)

:Known issues:

* OpenMPI does not work with direct MPI job launches in mpi4py comms mode, since it does not support nested MPI launches
  (Either use local mode or Balsam job controller).
* Local comms mode (multiprocessing) may fail if MPI is initialized before forking processors. This is thought to be responsible for issues combining with PETSc.
* Remote detection of logical cores via LSB_HOSTS (e.g., Summit) returns number of physical cores since SMT info not available.
* TCP mode does not support (1) more than one libEnsemble call in a given script or (2) the auto-resources option to the job controller.

Release 0.4.1

Release 0.3.0
-------------

:Date: September 7, 2018
