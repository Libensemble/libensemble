===========================
Introduction to libEnsemble
===========================

libEnsemble is a Python_ toolkit for coordinating workflows of asynchronous and dynamic ensembles of calculations.

libEnsemble can help users take advantage of massively parallel resources to solve design,
decision, and inference problems and expand the class of problems that can benefit from
increased parallelism.

libEnsemble aims for:

• **Extreme scaling**: Run on or across_ laptops, clusters, and leadership-class machines.
• **Dynamic Ensembles**: Generate new tasks on-the-fly based on previous computations.
• **Dynamic Resource Management**: Reassign resource partitions of any size for tasks.
• **Monitoring/killing of applications**: Ensemble members can poll or kill running apps.
• **Resilience/fault tolerance**: libEnsemble can restart incomplete tasks or entire ensembles.
• **Portability and flexibility**: Run identical libEnsemble scripts on different machines.
• **Exploitation of persistent data/control flow**: libEnsemble can pass data between ensemble members.
• **Low start-up cost**: Default single-machine deployments don't require additional services.

libEnsemble's users select or supply **generator** and **simulator** Python
functions; these respectively produce candidate parameters and perform/monitor
computations that use those parameters. Generator functions can train
models, perform optimizations, and test candidate solutions in a batch or streaming
fashion based on simulation results.
Simulator functions can themselves use parallel resources and involve libraries
or executables that are not written in Python.

With a basic familiarity of Python and NumPy_, users can easily incorporate
any other mathematics, machine-learning, or resource-management libraries into libEnsemble
workflows.

libEnsemble employs a manager/worker scheme that runs on MPI, multiprocessing,
or TCP. Workers control and monitor any level of work using the aforementioned
generator and simulator functions, from small subnode tasks to huge many-node computations.

libEnsemble includes an Executor interface so application-launching functions are
portable, resilient, and flexible; it also automatically detects available nodes
and cores, and can dynamically assign resources to workers.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required dependencies:

* Python_ 3.7 or above
* NumPy_
* psutil_

When using  ``mpi4py`` for libEnsemble communications:

* A functional MPI 1.x/2.x/3.x implementation, such as MPICH_, built with shared/dynamic libraries
* mpi4py_ v2.0.0 or above

Optional dependencies:

* Balsam_

If running on the the compute nodes of three-tier systems
like OLCF's Summit_ or ALCF's Theta_, libEnsemble's workers may use the Balsam service
to schedule and launch MPI applications. Otherwise, libEnsemble can be run with
multiprocessing on the intermediate launch nodes.

* pyyaml_

libEnsemble is typically configured and parameterized via Python dictionaries.
As of v0.8.0, libEnsemble can also be parameterized via yaml.

* funcX_

As of v0.8.0+dev, libEnsemble features a cross-system capability powered by funcX_,
a function-as-a-service platform to which workers can submit remote generator or
simulator function instances. This feature can help distribute an ensemble
across systems and heterogeneous resources.

The example simulation and generation functions and tests require the following:

* SciPy_
* mpmath_
* petsc4py_
* DEAP_
* DFO-LS_
* Tasmanian_
* NLopt_
* `PETSc/TAO`_ - Can optionally be installed by pip along with ``petsc4py``
* Surmise_

PETSc and NLopt must be built with shared libraries enabled and be present in
``sys.path`` (e.g., via setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable). NLopt
should produce a file ``nlopt.py`` if Python is found on the system. See the
`NLopt documentation` for information about building NLopt with shared
libraries. NLopt may also require SWIG_ to be installed on certain systems.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

libEnsemble can be installed or accessed from a variety of sources.

Install libEnsemble and its dependencies from PyPI_ using pip::

    pip install libensemble

Install libEnsemble with Conda_ from the conda-forge_ channel::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install -c conda-forge libensemble

Install libEnsemble using the Spack_ distribution::

    spack install py-libensemble

libEnsemble is included in the `xSDK Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit`_
from xSDK version 0.5.0 onward. Install the xSDK and load the environment with::

    spack install xsdk
    spack load -r xsdk

The codebase, tests and examples can be accessed in the GitHub_ repository.
If necessary, you may install all optional dependencies (listed above) at once
with::

    pip install libensemble[extras]

A tarball_ of the most recent release is also available.

Testing
~~~~~~~

The provided test suite includes both unit and regression tests and is run
regularly on:

* `GitHub Actions`_

The test suite requires the mock_, pytest_, pytest-cov_, and pytest-timeout_ packages
to be installed and can be run from the ``libensemble/tests`` directory
of the source distribution by running::

    ./run-tests.sh

Further options are available. To see a complete list of options, run::

    ./run-tests.sh -h

The regression tests also work as good example libEnsemble scripts and can
be run directly in ``libensemble/tests/regression_tests``. For example::

    cd libensemble/tests/regression_tests
    python test_uniform_sampling.py --comms local --nworkers 3

The ``libensemble/tests/scaling_tests`` directory includes example scripts that
use the executor to run compiled applications. These are tested regularly on
HPC systems.

If you have the libEnsemble source code, you can download (but not install) the testing
prerequisites and run the tests with::

    python setup.py test

in the top-level directory containing the setup script.

Coverage reports are produced separately for unit tests and regression tests
under the relevant directories. For parallel tests, the union of all processors
is taken. Furthermore, a combined coverage report is created at the top level,
which can be viewed at ``libensemble/tests/cov_merge/index.html``
after ``run_tests.sh`` is completed. The coverage results are available
online at Coveralls_.

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

The default manager/worker communications mode is MPI. The user script is
launched as::

    mpiexec -np N python myscript.py

where ``N`` is the number of processors. This will launch one manager and
``N-1`` workers.

If running in local mode, which uses Python's multiprocessing module, the
``local`` comms option and the number of workers must be specified, either in `libE_specs`_
or via the command-line using the ``parse_args()`` function. The script
can then be run as a regular Python script::

    python myscript.py --comms local --nworkers N

This will launch one manager and N workers.

See the `user guide`_ for more information.
