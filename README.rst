===========================
Introduction to libEnsemble
===========================

libEnsemble is a Python library to coordinate the concurrent evaluation of
dynamic ensembles of calculations. The library is developed to use massively
parallel resources to accelerate the solution of design, decision, and
inference problems and to expand the class of problems that can benefit from
increased concurrency levels.

libEnsemble aims for the following:

• Extreme scaling
• Resilience/fault tolerance
• Monitoring/killing of tasks (and recovering resources)
• Portability and flexibility
• Exploitation of persistent data/control flow

The user selects or supplies a function that generates simulation
input as well as a function that performs and monitors the
simulations. For example, the generation function may contain an
optimization routine to generate new simulation parameters on the fly based on
the results of previous simulations. Examples and templates of such functions are
included in the library.

libEnsemble employs a manager/worker scheme that can run on various
communication media (including MPI, multiprocessing, and TCP); interfacing with
user-provided executables is also supported. Each worker can
control and monitor any level of work, from small subnode tasks to huge
many-node simulations. An executor interface is provided to ensure that scripts
are portable, resilient, and flexible; it also enables automatic detection of
the nodes and cores in a system and can split up tasks automatically if resource
data isn't supplied.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required dependencies:

* Python_ 3.5 or above
* NumPy_

For libEnsemble running with the mpi4py parallelism:

* A functional MPI 1.x/2.x/3.x implementation, such as MPICH_, built with shared/dynamic libraries
* mpi4py_ v2.0.0 or above

Optional dependency:

* Balsam_

From v0.2.0, libEnsemble has the option of using the Balsam job manager. Balsam
is required in order to run libEnsemble on the compute nodes of some supercomputing
platforms that do not support launching tasks from compute nodes. As of v0.5.0,
libEnsemble can also be run on launch nodes using multiprocessing.

The example simulation and generation functions and tests require the following:

* SciPy_
* petsc4py_
* DFO-LS_
* Tasmanian_
* NLopt_
* PETSc_ - Can optionally be installed by pip along with petsc4py

PETSc and NLopt must be built with shared libraries enabled and present in
``sys.path`` (e.g., via setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable). NLopt
should produce a file ``nlopt.py`` if Python is found on the system. See the
`NLopt documentation` for information about building NLopt with shared
libraries. NLopt may also require SWIG_ to be installed on certain systems.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

libEnsemble may be installed or accessed from a variety of sources.

Use pip to install libEnsemble and its dependencies via ::

    pip install libensemble

libEnsemble is also available in the Spack_ distribution. It can be installed
from Spack with ::

    spack install py-libensemble

libEnsemble is included in the `xSDK Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit`_
from xSDK version 0.5.0 onward. Install the xSDK and load the environment with ::

    spack install xsdk
    spack load -r xsdk

The codebase, tests and examples can be accessed in the GitHub_ repository.
If necessary, you may install all optional dependencies (listed above) at once
with ::

    pip install libensemble[extras]

A tarball_ of the most recent release is also available.

Testing
~~~~~~~

The provided test suite includes both unit and regression tests and is run
regularly on

* `Travis CI`_

The test suite requires the mock_, pytest_, pytest-cov_, and pytest-timeout_
packages to be installed and can be run from the ``libensemble/tests`` directory
of the source distribution by running ::

    ./run-tests.sh

To clean the test repositories, run ::

    ./run-tests.sh -c

Further options are available. To see a complete list of options, run ::

    ./run-tests.sh -h

If you have the source distribution, you can download (but not install) the testing
prerequisites and run the tests with ::

    python setup.py test

in the top-level directory containing the setup script.

Coverage reports are produced separately for unit tests and regression tests
under the relevant directories. For parallel tests, the union of all processors
is taken. Furthermore, a combined coverage report is created at the top level,
which can be viewed at ``libensemble/tests/cov_merge/index.html``
after ``run_tests.sh`` is completed. The Travis CI coverage results are
available online at Coveralls_.

.. note::
    The executor tests can be run by using the direct-launch or
    Balsam executors. Balsam integration with libEnsemble is now tested
    via ``test_balsam_hworld.py``.

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples directory contains example libEnsemble calling scripts, simulation
functions, generation functions, allocation functions, and libEnsemble submission scripts.

The default manager/worker communications mode is MPI. The user script is
launched as ::

    mpiexec -np N python myscript.py

where ``N`` is the number of processors. This will launch one manager and
``N-1`` workers.

If running in local mode, which uses Python's multiprocessing module, the
``local`` comms option and the number of workers must be specified. The script
can then be run as a regular Python script::

    python myscript.py

These options may be specified via the command line by using the ``parse_args()``
convenience function within libEnsemble's ``tools`` module.

See the `user guide`_ for more information.
