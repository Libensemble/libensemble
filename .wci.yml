headline: Tool for running dynamic ensembles.
description: |
  libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for coordinating workflows of asynchronous
  and dynamic ensembles of calculations.

  Users write generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles.
  A library of example functions is available which can be modified as needed.
  These functions can submit unmodified external executables at any scale and
  in a portable way. System details are detected, and resource management is
  provided.

  libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and
  supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.
