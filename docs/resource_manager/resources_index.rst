Resource Manager
================

libEnsemble comes with built-in resource management. This entails the detection
of available resources (e.g., nodelists, core counts, and GPUs), and the allocation
of resources to workers.

Resource management can be disabled by setting
``libE_specs["disable_resource_manager"] = True``. This will prevent libEnsemble
from doing any resource detection or management.
