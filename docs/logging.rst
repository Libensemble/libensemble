Logging
=======

The libEnsemble logger uses the standard Python logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
plus one additional custom level (MANAGER_WARNING) between WARNING and ERROR.

The default level is INFO, which includes information about how tasks are submitted
and when tasks are killed. To gain additional diagnostics, set the logging level
to DEBUG. libEnsemble produces logging to the file ``ensemble.log`` by default. A log
file name can also be supplied.

To change the logging level to DEBUG, provide the following in the calling scripts::

    from libensemble import logger
    logger.set_level('DEBUG')

Logger messages of MANAGER_WARNING level or higher are also displayed through stderr by default.
This boundary can be adjusted as follows::

    from libensemble import logger

    # Only display messages with level >= ERROR
    logger.set_stderr_level('ERROR')

stderr displaying can be effectively disabled by setting the stderr level to CRITICAL.
