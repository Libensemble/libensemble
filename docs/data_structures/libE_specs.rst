General Options - libE Specs
============================

libEnsemble is primarily customized by setting options within a ``libE_specs`` dictionary or using the ``LibeSpecs`` class.
Valid options are categorized and listed below. When provided as a Python class,
options are validated immediately on instantiation. When provided as a dictionary, all data is validated
upon passing into :meth:`libE()<libensemble.libE.libE>`.

::

    libE_specs: [dict, optional]:

        General options:
        ----------------
        "comms" [str]:
            Manager/Worker communications mode. Default: mpi
            Options are "mpi", "local", "tcp"
        "nworkers" [int]:
            Number of worker processes to spawn (only in local/tcp modes)
        "mpi_comm" [MPI communicator]:
            libEnsemble communicator. Default: MPI.COMM_WORLD
        "abort_on_exception" [bool]:
            In MPI mode, whether to call MPI_ABORT on an exception. Default: True
            If False, an exception will be raised by the manager.
        "save_every_k_sims" [int]:
            Save history array to file after every k simulated points.
        "save_every_k_gens" [int]:
            Save history array to file after every k generated points.
        "save_H_and_persis_on_abort" [bool]:
            Whether libEnsemble should save the states of H and persis_info on
            aborting after an error.
            Default: True
        "worker_timeout" [int]:
            When libEnsemble concludes and attempts to close down worker processes,
            the number of seconds after which workers are considered timed out. Worker
            processes are then terminated. multiprocessing default: 1
        "kill_canceled_sims" [bool]:
            Will libE try to kill sims that user functions mark "cancel_requested" as True.
            If False, the manager avoids this moderate overhead.
            Default: True

        Directory management options:
        -----------------------------
        "ensemble_dir_path" [str]:
            Path to main ensemble directory containing calculation directories. Can serve
            as single working directory for workers, or contain calculation directories.
            Default: "./ensemble"
        "ensemble_copy_back" [bool]:
            Whether to copy back directories within ensemble_dir_path back to launch
            location. Useful if ensemble_dir placed on node-local storage.

        "use_worker_dirs" [bool]:
            Whether to organize calculation directories under worker-specific directories.
            Default: False

        "sim_dirs_make" [bool]:
            Whether to make simulation-specific calculation directories for each sim call.
            This will create a directory for each simulation, even if no sim_input_dir is
            specified. If False, all workers operate within the ensemble directory
            described below.
            Default: False
        "sim_dir_copy_files" [list]:
            Paths to files or directories to copy into each sim directory, or ensemble directory.

            Paths to files or directories to symlink into each sim directory.
        "sim_input_dir" [str]:
            Copy this directory and its contents for each simulation-specific directory.
            If not using calculation directories, contents are copied to the ensemble directory.

        "gen_dirs_make" [bool]:
            Whether to make generator-instance specific calculation directories for each
            gen call. This will create a directory for each generator call, even if no
            gen_input_dir is specified. If False, all workers operate within the ensemble

            Paths to files or directories to copy into each gen directory, or ensemble directory.
        "gen_dir_symlink_files" [list]:
            Paths to files or directories to symlink into each gen directory.
        "gen_input_dir" [str]:
            Copy this directory and its contents for each generator-instance specific directory.
            If not using calc directories, contents are copied to the ensemble directory.

            moderate overhead.
            Default: True
        "stats_fmt" [dict]:
            A dictionary of options for formatting the "libE_stats.txt" output file.

        TCP only options:
        -----------------
        "workers" [list]:
            TCP Only: A list of worker hostnames.
        "ip" [str]:
            TCP Only: IP address for Manager's system
        "port" [int]:
            TCP Only: Port number for Manager's system

            Default: None

        Resource management options:
        ----------------------------
        "disable_resource_manager" [bool]:
            Disable the built-in resource manager. If this is True, automatic resource detection
            and/or assignment of resources to workers is disabled. This also means that
            any entries in the "resource_info" option will be ignored.
            Default: False
        "num_resource_sets" [int]:
            The total number of resource sets. Resources will be divided into this number.
            Default: None. If None, resources will be divided by workers (excluding
            zero_resource_workers).
        "enforce_worker_core_bounds" [bool]:
            If False, the Executor will permit submission of tasks with a
            higher processor count than the CPUs available to the worker as
            detected by the resource manager. Larger node counts are not allowed.
            When the libE_specs option "disable_resource_manager" is True,
            this argument is ignored. Default: False
        "dedicated_mode" [bool]:
            If True, then running in dedicated mode, otherwise in distributed
            mode. Dedicated mode means libE processes (manager and workers) are
            grouped together and do not share nodes with applications.
            Distributed mode means workers share nodes with applications.
            Default: False
        "zero_resource_workers" [list of ints]:
            List of workers that require no resources. For when a fixed mapping of workers
            to resources is required. Otherwise, use "num_resource_sets".
            For use with supported allocation functions.
        "resource_info" [dict]:
            Provide resource information that will override automatically detected resources.
            The allowable fields are given below in "Overriding Auto-detection"
            Note that if "disable_resource_manager" is set then
            this option is ignored.
        "scheduler_opts" [dict]:
            A dictionary of options for the resource scheduler.
            See "Scheduler Options" for more options.
