persis_info
===========

Supply persistent information to libEnsemble::

    persis_info: [dict]:
        Dictionary containing persistent info

Holds data that is passed to and from workers updating some state information. A typical example
is a random number generator to be used in consecutive calls to a generator. *Optional*.

If worker ``i`` sends back ``persis_info``, it is stored in ``persis_info[i]``. This functionality
can be used to, for example, pass a random stream back to the manager to be included in future work
from the allocation function.
