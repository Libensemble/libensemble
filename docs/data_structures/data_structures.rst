Configuring libEnsemble
=======================

This section outlines the dictionaries, classes, and other structures used by libEnsemble
to configure a workflow, oftentimes within a single Python file we refer to as a *calling script*.
See the :ref:`libE() Module<libe-module>` docs for more information on combining these together into
a complete libEnsemble workflow, or using the alternative yaml interface.
