Generator Functions
===================

Generator and :ref:`Simulator functions<funcguides-sim>` have relatively similar interfaces.

.. code-block:: python

    def my_generator(Input, persis_info, gen_specs, libE_info):
        batch_size = gen_specs["user"]["batch_size"]

        Output = np.zeros(batch_size, gen_specs["out"])
        ...
        Output["x"], persis_info = generate_next_simulation_inputs(Input["f"], persis_info)

        return Output, persis_info

Most ``gen_f`` function definitions written by users resemble::

    def my_generator(Input, persis_info, gen_specs, libE_info):

where:

    * ``Input`` is a selection of the :ref:`History array<funcguides-history>`
    * :ref:`persis_info<datastruct-persis-info>` is a dictionary containing state information
    * :ref:`gen_specs<datastruct-gen-specs>` is a dictionary of generator parameters, including which fields from the History array got sent
    *  ``libE_info`` is a dictionary containing libEnsemble-specific entries

Valid generator functions can accept a subset of the above parameters. So a very simple generator can start::

    def my_generator(Input):

If gen_specs was initially defined::

    gen_specs = {
        "gen_f": some_function,
        "in": ["f"],
        "out:" ["x", float, (1,)],
        "user": {
            "batch_size": 128
        }
    }

Then user parameters and a *local* array of outputs may be obtained/initialized like::

    batch_size = gen_specs["user"]["batch_size"]
    Output = np.zeros(batch_size, dtype=gen_specs["out"])

This array should be populated by whatever values are generated within
the function::

    Output["x"], persis_info = generate_next_simulation_inputs(Input["f"], persis_info)

Then return the array and ``persis_info`` to libEnsemble::

    return Output, persis_info

Between the ``Output`` definition and the ``return``, any level and complexity
of computation can be performed. Users are encouraged to use the :doc:`executor<../executor/overview>`
to submit applications to parallel resources if necessary, or plug in components from
other libraries to serve their needs.

.. note::

    State ``gen_f`` information like checkpointing should be
    appended to ``persis_info``.

.. _persistent-gens:

Persistent Generators
---------------------

While non-persistent generators return after completing their calculation, persistent
generators do the following in a loop:

    1. Receive simulation results and metadata; exit if metadata instructs
    2. Perform analysis
    3. Send subsequent simulation parameters

Persistent generators don't need to be re-initialized on each call, but are typically
more complicated. The :doc:`APOSMM<../examples/aposmm>`
optimization generator function included with libEnsemble is persistent so it can
maintain multiple local optimization subprocesses based on results from complete simulations.

Use ``gen_specs["persis_in"]`` to specify fields to send back to the generator throughout the run.
``gen_specs["in"]`` only describes the input fields when the function is **first called**.

Functions for a persistent generator to communicate directly with the manager
are available in the :ref:`libensemble.tools.persistent_support<p_gen_routines>` class.

Sending/receiving data is supported by the :ref:`PersistentSupport<p_gen_routines>` class::

    from libensemble.tools import PersistentSupport
    from libensemble.message_numbers import STOP_TAG, PERSIS_STOP, EVAL_GEN_TAG, FINISHED_PERSISTENT_GEN_TAG

    my_support = PersistentSupport(libE_info, EVAL_GEN_TAG)

Implementing functions from the above class is relatively simple:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: send

        .. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.persistent_support.PersistentSupport
        .. autofunction:: send

        This function call typically resembles::

            my_support.send(local_H_out[selected_IDs])

        Note that this function has no return.

    .. tab-item:: recv

        .. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.persistent_support.PersistentSupport
        .. autofunction:: recv

        This function call typically resembles::

            tag, Work, calc_in = my_support.recv()

            if tag in [STOP_TAG, PERSIS_STOP]:
                cleanup()
                break

        The logic following the function call is typically used to break the persistent
        generator's main loop and return.

    .. tab-item:: send_recv

        .. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.persistent_support.PersistentSupport
        .. autofunction:: send_recv

        This function performs both of the previous functions in a single statement. Its
        usage typically resembles::

            tag, Work, calc_in = my_support.send_recv(local_H_out[selected_IDs])
            if tag in [STOP_TAG, PERSIS_STOP]:
                cleanup()
                break

        Once the persistent generator's loop has been broken because of
        the tag from the manager, it should return with an additional tag::

            return local_H_out, persis_info, FINISHED_PERSISTENT_GEN_TAG

See :ref:`calc_status<funcguides-calcstatus>` for more information about
the message tags.

.. _gen_active_recv:

Active receive mode
-------------------

By default, a persistent worker is expected to
receive and send data in a *ping pong* fashion. Alternatively,
a worker can be initiated in *active receive* mode by the allocation
function (see :ref:`start_only_persistent<start_only_persistent_label>`).
The persistent worker can then send and receive from the manager at any time.

Ensure there are no communication deadlocks in this mode. In manager--worker message exchanges, only the worker-side
receive is blocking by default (a non-blocking option is available).

Cancelling Simulations
----------------------

Previously submitted simulations can be cancelled by sending a message to the manager:

.. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.persistent_support.PersistentSupport
.. autofunction:: request_cancel_sim_ids

- If a generated point is cancelled by the generator **before sending** to another worker for simulation, then it won't be sent.
- If that point has **already been evaluated** by a simulation, the ``cancel_requested`` field will remain ``True``.
- If that point is **currently being evaluated**, a kill signal will be sent to the corresponding worker; it must be manually processed in the simulation function.

The :doc:`Borehole Calibration tutorial<../tutorials/calib_cancel_tutorial>` gives an example
of the capability to cancel pending simulations.

Modification of existing points
-------------------------------

To change existing fields of the History array, create a NumPy array where the ``dtype`` contains
the ``sim_id`` and the fields to be modified. Send this array with ``keep_state=True`` to the manager.
This will overwrite the manager's History array.

For example, the cancellation function ``request_cancel_sim_ids`` could be replicated by
the following (where ``sim_ids_to_cancel`` is a list of integers):

.. code-block:: python

    # Send only these fields to existing H rows and libEnsemble will slot in the change.
    H_o = np.zeros(len(sim_ids_to_cancel), dtype=[("sim_id", int), ("cancel_requested", bool)])
    H_o["sim_id"] = sim_ids_to_cancel
    H_o["cancel_requested"] = True
    ps.send(H_o, keep_state=True)

Generator initiated shutdown
----------------------------

If using a supporting allocation function, the generator can prompt the ensemble to shutdown
by simply exiting the function (e.g., on a test for a converged value). For example, the
allocation function :ref:`start_only_persistent<start_only_persistent_label>` closes down
the ensemble as soon as a persistent generator returns. The usual return values should be given.

Examples
--------

Examples of non-persistent and persistent generator functions
can be found :doc:`here<../examples/gen_funcs>`.
