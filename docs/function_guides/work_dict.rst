Work Dictionary
===============

The work dictionary contains metadata that is used by the manager to send a packet
of work to a worker. The dictionary uses integer keys ``i`` and values that determine
the data given to worker ``i``. Populated in the allocation function. ``Work[i]`` has the following form::

    Work[i]: [dict]:

        Required keys:
        "H_fields" [list]: The field names of the history H to be sent to worker i
        "persis_info" [dict]: Any persistent info to be sent to worker i
        "tag" [int]: "EVAL_SIM_TAG"/"EVAL_GEN_TAG" if worker i is to call sim/gen_func
        "libE_info" [dict]: Info sent to/from worker to help manager update the H array

        libE_info contains the following:
        "H_rows" [list of ints]: History rows to send to worker i
        "rset_team" [list of ints]: The resource sets to be assigned (if dynamic scheduling is used)
        "persistent" [bool]: True if worker i will enter persistent mode (Default: False)

The work dictionary is typically set using the ``gen_work`` or ``sim_work``
:doc:`helper functions<../function_guides/allocator>` in the allocation function.
``H_fields``, for example, is usually packed from either ``sim_specs["in"]``, ``gen_specs["in"]``
or the equivalent "persis_in" variants.
