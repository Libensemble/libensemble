calc_status
===========

The ``calc_status`` is similar to an exit code, and is either a built-in integer
attribute with a named (enumerated) value and corresponding description, or a
user-specified string. They are determined within user functions to capture the
status of a calculation, and returned to the manager and printed to the ``libE_stats.txt`` file.
Only the status values ``FINISHED_PERSISTENT_SIM_TAG`` and ``FINISHED_PERSISTENT_GEN_TAG``
are currently used by the manager, but others can still provide a useful summary in ``libE_stats.txt``.
The user is responsible for determining the status of a user function instance, since
a given instance could include multiple application runs of mixed rates of success.

The ``calc_status`` is the third optional return value from a user function.
Built-in codes are available in the ``libensemble.message_numbers`` module, but
users are also free to return any custom string.

Example of ``calc_status`` used along with :ref:`Executor<executor_index>` in sim_f:

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 4,16,19,22,30

    from libensemble.message_numbers import WORKER_DONE, WORKER_KILL, TASK_FAILED

    task = exctr.submit(calc_type="sim", num_procs=cores, wait_on_start=True)
    calc_status = UNSET_TAG
    poll_interval = 1  # secs
    while not task.finished:
        if task.runtime > time_limit:
            task.kill()  # Timeout
        else:
            time.sleep(poll_interval)
            task.poll()

    if task.finished:
        if task.state == "FINISHED":
            print("Task {} completed".format(task.name))
            calc_status = WORKER_DONE
        elif task.state == "FAILED":
            print("Warning: Task {} failed: Error code {}".format(task.name, task.errcode))
            calc_status = TASK_FAILED
        elif task.state == "USER_KILLED":
            print("Warning: Task {} has been killed".format(task.name))
            calc_status = WORKER_KILL
        else:
            print("Warning: Task {} in unknown state {}. Error code {}".format(task.name, task.state, task.errcode))

    outspecs = sim_specs["out"]
    output = np.zeros(1, dtype=outspecs)
    output["energy"][0] = final_energy

    return output, persis_info, calc_status

Example of defining and returning a custom ``calc_status`` if the built-in values
are insufficient:

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

    from libensemble.message_numbers import WORKER_DONE, TASK_FAILED

    task = exctr.submit(calc_type="sim", num_procs=cores, wait_on_start=True)

    task.wait(timeout=60)

    file_output = read_task_output(task)
    if task.errcode == 0:
        if "fail" in file_output:
            calc_status = "Task failed successfully?"
        else:
            calc_status = WORKER_DONE
    else:
        calc_status = TASK_FAILED

    outspecs = sim_specs["out"]
    output = np.zeros(1, dtype=outspecs)
    output["energy"][0] = final_energy

    return output, persis_info, calc_status

See forces_simf.py_ for a complete example.
See uniform_or_localopt.py_ for an example of using ``FINISHED_PERSISTENT_GEN_TAG``.

Available values:

The corresponding messages printed to the ``libE_stats.txt`` file:
