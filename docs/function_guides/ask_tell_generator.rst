Ask/Tell Generators
===================

**BETA - SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

These generators, implementations, methods, and subclasses are in BETA, and
may change in future releases.

The Generator interface is expected to roughly correspond with CAMPA's standard:
https://github.com/campa-consortium/generator_standard

libEnsemble is in the process of supporting generator objects that implement the following interface:

.. automodule:: generators
  :members: Generator LibensembleGenerator
  :undoc-members:
  :no-index:

.. autoclass:: Generator
  :member-order: bysource
  :members:
  :no-index:
