Base Executor - Local apps
==========================

.. automodule:: executor
  :no-undoc-members:

See the Executor APIs for optional arguments.

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Base Executor

    Only for running local serial-launched applications.
    To run MPI applications and use detected resources, use the :doc:`MPIExecutor<../executor/mpi_executor>`

    .. autoclass:: libensemble.executors.executor.Executor
      :members:
      :exclude-members: serial_setup, sim_default_app, gen_default_app, get_app, default_app, set_resources, get_task, set_workerID, set_worker_info, new_tasks_timing, add_platform_info, set_gen_procs_gpus, kill, poll

      .. automethod:: __init__

  .. tab-item:: Task

    .. _task_tag:

    Tasks are created and returned by the Executor's ``submit()``. Tasks
    can be polled, killed, and waited on with the respective ``poll``, ``kill``, and ``wait`` functions.
    Task information can be queried through instance attributes and query functions.

    .. autoclass:: libensemble.executors.executor.Task
      :members:
      :exclude-members: calc_task_timing, check_poll

  .. tab-item:: Task Attributes

    .. note::
        These should not be set directly. Tasks are launched by the Executor,
        and task information can be queried through the task attributes
        below and the query functions.

    :task.state: (string) The task status. One of
                ("UNKNOWN"|"CREATED"|"WAITING"|"RUNNING"|"FINISHED"|"USER_KILLED"|"FAILED"|"FAILED_TO_START")

    :task.process: (process obj) The process object used by the underlying process
                  manager (e.g., return value of subprocess.Popen).
    :task.errcode: (int) The error code (or return code) used by the underlying process manager.
    :task.finished: (boolean) True means task has finished running - not whether it was successful.
    :task.success: (boolean) Did task complete successfully (e.g., the return code is zero)?
    :task.runtime: (int) Time in seconds that task has been running.
    :task.submit_time: (int) Time since epoch that task was submitted.
    :task.total_time: (int) Total time from task submission to completion (only available when task is finished).

    Run configuration attributes - some will be autogenerated:

    :task.workdir: (string) Work directory for the task
    :task.name: (string) Name of task - autogenerated
    :task.app: (app obj) Use application/executable, registered using exctr.register_app
    :task.app_args: (string) Application arguments as a string
    :task.stdout: (string) Name of file where the standard output of the task is written (in task.workdir)
    :task.stderr: (string) Name of file where the standard error of the task is written (in task.workdir)
    :task.dry_run: (boolean) True if task corresponds to dry run (no actual submission)
    :task.runline: (string) Complete, parameterized command to be subprocessed to launch app
