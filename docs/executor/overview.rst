Executor Overview
=================

Most computationally expensive libEnsemble workflows involve launching applications
from a :ref:`sim_f<api_sim_f>` or :ref:`gen_f<api_gen_f>` running on a worker to the
compute nodes of a supercomputer, cluster, or other compute resource.

The **Executor** provides a portable interface for running applications on any system.

.. dropdown:: Detailed description

    An **Executor** interface is provided by libEnsemble to remove the burden
    of system interaction from the user and improve workflow portability. Users
    first register their applications to Executor instances, which then return
    corresponding ``Task`` objects upon submission within user functions.

    **Task** attributes and retrieval functions can be queried to determine
    the status of running application instances. Functions are also provided
    to access and interrogate files in the task's working directory.

    libEnsemble's Executors and Tasks contain many familiar features and methods
    to Python's native `concurrent futures`_ interface. Executors feature the
    ``submit()`` function for launching apps (detailed below),  but currently do
    not support ``map()`` or ``shutdown()``. Tasks are much like ``futures``.
    They feature the ``cancel()``, ``cancelled()``, ``running()``, ``done()``,
    ``result()``, and ``exception()`` functions from the standard.

    The main ``Executor`` class can subprocess serial applications in place,
    while the ``MPIExecutor`` is used for running MPI applications, and the
    ``BalsamExecutor`` for submitting MPI run requests from a worker running on
    a compute node to the Balsam service. This second approach is suitable for
    systems that don't allow submitting MPI applications from compute nodes.

    Typically, users choose and parameterize their ``Executor`` objects in their
    calling scripts, where each executable generator or simulation application is
    registered to it. If an alternative Executor like Balsam is used, then the
    applications can be registered as in the example below. Once in the user-side
    worker code (sim/gen func), the Executor can be retrieved without any need to
    specify the type.

    Once the Executor is retrieved, tasks can be submitted by specifying the
    ``app_name`` from registration in the calling script alongside other optional
    parameters described in the API.

Basic usage
-----------

**In calling script**

To set up an MPI executor, register an MPI application, and add
to the ensemble object.

.. code-block:: python

    from libensemble import Ensemble
    from libensemble.executors import MPIExecutor

    exctr = MPIExecutor()
    exctr.register_app(full_path="/path/to/my/exe", app_name="sim1")
    ensemble = Ensemble(executor=exctr)

If using the ``libE()`` call, the Executor in the calling script does **not**
have to be passed to the ``libE()`` function. It is transferred via the
``Executor.executor`` class variable.

**In user simulation function**::

    def sim_func(H, persis_info, sim_specs, libE_info):

        input_param = str(int(H["x"][0][0]))
        exctr = libE_info["executor"]

        task = exctr.submit(
            app_name="sim1",
            num_procs=8,
            app_args=input_param,
            stdout="out.txt",
            stderr="err.txt",
        )

        # Wait for task to complete
        task.wait()

Example use-cases:

* :doc:`Electrostatic Forces example <../tutorials/executor_forces_tutorial>`: Launches the ``forces.x`` MPI application.

* :doc:`Forces example with GPUs <../tutorials/forces_gpu_tutorial>`: Auto-assigns GPUs via executor.

See the :doc:`Executor<executor>` or :doc:`MPIExecutor<mpi_executor>` interface
for the complete API.

See :doc:`Running on HPC Systems<../platforms/platforms_index>` for illustrations
of how common options such as ``libE_specs["dedicated_mode"]`` affect the
run configuration on clusters and supercomputers.

Advanced Features
-----------------

**Example of polling output and killing application:**

In simulation function (sim_f).

.. code-block:: python

    import time


    def sim_func(H, persis_info, sim_specs, libE_info):
        input_param = str(int(H["x"][0][0]))
        exctr = libE_info["executor"]

        task = exctr.submit(
            app_name="sim1",
            num_procs=8,
            app_args=input_param,
            stdout="out.txt",
            stderr="err.txt",
        )

        timeout_sec = 600
        poll_delay_sec = 1

        while not task.finished:
            # Has manager sent a finish signal
            if exctr.manager_kill_received():
                task.kill()
                my_cleanup()

            # Check output file for error and kill task
            elif task.stdout_exists():
                if "Error" in task.read_stdout():
                    task.kill()

            elif task.runtime > timeout_sec:
                task.kill()  # Timeout

            else:
                time.sleep(poll_delay_sec)
                task.poll()

        print(task.state)  # state may be finished/failed/killed

.. The Executor can also be retrieved using Python's ``with`` context switching statement,
.. although this is effectively syntactical sugar to above::
..
..     from libensemble.executors import Executor
..
..     with Executor.executor as exctr:
..         task = exctr.submit(app_name="sim1", num_procs=8, app_args="input.txt",
..                             stdout="out.txt", stderr="err.txt")
..     ...

Users who wish to poll only for manager kill signals and timeouts don't necessarily
need to construct a polling loop like above, but can instead use the ``Executor``
built-in ``polling_loop()`` method. An alternative to the above simulation function
may resemble:

.. code-block:: python

    def sim_func(H, persis_info, sim_specs, libE_info):
        input_param = str(int(H["x"][0][0]))
        exctr = libE_info["executor"]

        task = exctr.submit(
            app_name="sim1",
            num_procs=8,
            app_args=input_param,
            stdout="out.txt",
            stderr="err.txt",
        )

        timeout_sec = 600
        poll_delay_sec = 1

        exctr.polling_loop(task, timeout=timeout_sec, delay=poll_delay_sec)

        print(task.state)  # state may be finished/failed/killed

.. note::
    Applications or tasks submitted via the Balsam Executor are referred to as
    **"jobs"** within Balsam, including within Balsam's database and when
    describing the state of a completed submission.

The ``MPIExecutor`` autodetects system criteria such as the appropriate MPI launcher
and mechanisms to poll and kill tasks. It also has access to the resource manager,
which partitions resources amongst workers, ensuring that runs utilize different
resources (e.g., nodes). Furthermore, the ``MPIExecutor`` offers resilience via the
feature of re-launching tasks that fail to start because of system factors.

Various back-end mechanisms may be used by the Executor to best interact
with each system, including proxy launchers or task management systems such as
Balsam_. Currently, these Executors launch at the application level within
an existing resource pool. However, submissions to a batch scheduler may be
supported in future Executors.
