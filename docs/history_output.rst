The History Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
libEnsemble uses a NumPy structured array :ref:`H<datastruct-history-array>` to
store corresponding output from each ``gen_f`` and ``sim_f``. Similarly,
``gen_f`` and ``sim_f`` are expected to return output as NumPy structured
arrays. The names of the input fields for ``gen_f`` and ``sim_f``
must be output from ``gen_f`` or ``sim_f``. In addition to the user-function output fields,
the final history from libEnsemble will include the following:

* ``sim_id`` [int]: Each unit of work output from ``gen_f`` must have an
  associated ``sim_id``. The generator can assign this, but users must be
  careful to ensure that points are added in order. For example, if ``alloc_f``
  allows for two ``gen_f`` instances to be running simultaneously, ``alloc_f``
  should ensure that both donâ€™t generate points with the same ``sim_id``.

* ``given`` [bool]: Has this ``gen_f`` output been given to a libEnsemble
  worker to be evaluated yet?

* ``given_time`` [float]: At what time (since the epoch) was this ``gen_f``
  output given to a worker?

* ``sim_worker`` [int]: libEnsemble worker that output was given to for evaluation

* ``gen_worker`` [int]: libEnsemble worker that generated this ``sim_id``

* ``gen_time`` [float]: At what time (since the epoch) was this entry (or
  collection of entries) put into ``H`` by the manager

* ``returned`` [bool]: Has this worker completed the evaluation of this unit of
  work?

History and Log Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The history array :ref:`H<datastruct-history-array>` and
:ref:`persis_info<datastruct-persis-info>` dictionary are returned to the user
by libEnsemble.  If libEnsemble aborts on an exception, these structures are
dumped automatically to the respective files:

* ``libE_history_at_abort_<sim_count>.npy``
* ``libE_history_at_abort_<sim_count>.pickle``

where ``sim_count`` is the number of points evaluated. To suppress libEnsemble
from producing these two files, set ``libE_specs['save_H_and_persis_on_abort']`` to ``False``.

Two other libEnsemble files produced by default:

* ``libE_stats.txt``: This contains one-line summaries for each user
  calculation. Each summary is sent by workers to the manager and
  logged as the run progresses.

* ``ensemble.log``: This contains logging output from libEnsemble. The default
  logging level is INFO. In order to gain additional diagnostics, the logging
  level can be set to DEBUG. If this file is not removed, multiple runs will
  append output. Messages at or above MANAGER_WARNING are also copied to stderr
  to alert the user promptly. For more info, see :doc:`Logging<logging>`.

To suppress libEnsemble from producing these two files, set ``libE_specs['disable_log_files']`` to ``True``.

Output Working Directory Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
libEnsemble features configurable output and working directory structuring for
storing results at every step of a calculation, or directing workers to perform
calculations on separate filesystems or directories. This is helpful for users
performing I/O-heavy simulations who want to take advantage of high-speed
scratch spaces or disks.

Each time a worker initiates a simulation routine, libEnsemble copies a
specified input directory and its contents to a new location. The worker
will run inside this new directory for the duration of the routine. How these
directories are copied or labeled is configurable through settings
in :ref:`libE_specs<datastruct-libe-specs>`. Each setting will be described in
detail here:

* ``'sim_input_dir'``: The directory to be copied. Specify this
  option to enable the following features. Can be empty::

    libE_specs['sim_input_dir'] = './my_input'

* ``'ensemble_dir'``: Where to write directory copies. This location is where each
  worker will perform it's work, so a scratch space is recommended if
  performing I/O-heavy calculations. If not specified, writes directories to a
  new directory named ``ensemble`` in the current working directory::

      libE_specs['ensemble_dir'] = '/scratch/current_run/my_ensemble'

* ``'use_worker_dirs'``: Boolean. If enabled, libEnsemble also creates
  per-worker directories to store the calculation directories used by each worker.
  Particularly useful for organization when running with multiple workers on
  global scratch spaces or on the same node, and may produce performance benefits.

    Default structure with ``'use_worker_dirs'`` unspecified::

        - /my_ensemble
            - /sim0-worker1
            - /sim1-worker2
            - /sim2-worker3
            - /sim3-worker4
            ...

    Structure with ``libE_specs['use_worker_dirs'] = True``::

        - /my_ensemble
            - /worker1
                - /sim0
                - /sim4
                ...
            - /worker2
            - /worker3
            ...

* ``'copy_input_files'``: A list of filenames to exclusively copy from the input
  directory to each calculation directory. When specified, all other files in the
  input directory will be ignored unless specified in
  ``'symlink_input_files'`` (described next)::

      libE_specs['copy_input_files'] = ['copy_this']

        - /input_directory
            - /copy_this
            - /not_this

        - /my_ensemble
            - /sim0-worker1
                - /copy_this
            - /sim1-worker2
            ...

* ``'symlink_input_files'``: A list of filenames. Of the files copied from the
  input directory into each calculation directory, create symlinks for these
  files instead, pointing to the source in the input directory::

    libE_specs['symlink_input_files'] = ['symlink_this']

    - /input_directory
        - /copy_this
        - /symlink_this

    - /my_ensemble
        - /sim0-worker1
            - /copy_this
            - /symlink_this@ -> /path/input_directory/symlink_this
        - /sim1-worker2
        ...

* ``'copy_input_to_parent'``: Boolean. Also copy *all* input directory contents
  (regardless of other settings) to whichever directories directly contain
  calculation directories. By default, this is the ensemble directory. If
  ``'use_worker_dirs'`` is ``True``, then this is each worker directory. This
  also changes the behavior of ``'symlink_input_files'`` so calculation
  directory symlinks refer to these copies instead of those in the input directory.
  Performance may improve since simulations accessing symlinked files can refer
  to a copy on a scratch space, but less copies are made than if the file was
  copied for each calculation::

    - /input_directory
        - /copy_this
        - /symlink_this

    - /my_ensemble
        - /copy_this
        - /symlink_this
        - /sim0-worker1
              - /copy_this
              - /symlink_this@ -> /my_ensemble/symlink_this
          - /sim1-worker2
          ...

* ``'copy_back_output'``: Boolean. Following libEnsemble execution, copy the contents
  of the ensemble directory back to the directory where libEnsemble was originally
  launched.

.. note::
    Using ``'copy_back_output'`` with ``'symlink_input_files'`` and ``'copy_input_to_parent'``
    may break symlinks in the copied-back directory because the original symlinks
    referred to copies stored on each node's local scratch during execution.

* ``'clean_ensemble_dirs'``: Boolean. Following libEnsemble execution, clean all
  worker and calculation directories and their contents from the output ensemble
  directory. Copied input is currently not removed if using ``'copy_input_to_parent'``
  and not ``'use_worker_dirs'`` If writing to local scratch spaces on compute nodes,
  this data may be deleted anyway after the scheduled task finishes.

See the regression test ``test_worker_sim_dirs.py`` for examples of many of
these settings.

.. note::
  The ``postproc_scripts`` directory, in the libEnsemble project root directory,
  contains scripts to compare outputs and create plots based on the ensemble output.
