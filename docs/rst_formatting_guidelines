GENERAL
-------

    Put variables (e.g., gen_f or H) in between double ticks ``stuff here`` (no quotes).

    Code or monospaced values that contain quotes should only use double-quotes ("stuff_here").

    Use italics for emphasis except within links.

    Put short code, file-names, and environment variables within ``double ticks`` (no quotes).

    "where" should be lowercased when describing variables in a formula or code sample.

    Use tabs to compare multiple approaches or categorize content.

    Use dropdowns for multiple long-content sections on the same page.

    Acronym for "example": "e.g.," (note the final period and comma). Acronym for "number of": "No. of" (note the period after "No").

    Use semicolons; they're helpful for two smaller sentences describing the same topic.

CODE DOCSTRINGS AND TYPE HINTS
------------------------------

    Ensure parameter types, return types, and contents of :obj:`label`, :class:`label`, and other instances are "resolvable" (importable/parsable by Python) to the best of your ability. If not, append to "nitpicky".

    Ensure global types in docstrings match their builtin/typing class or name; "string" should be "str", "optional" should be "Optional".

    "List of object" should be "List[object]".

    List-items of parameters, fields, or other items should end with periods.

DOCS PAGES
----------

    Subsections should be Title Cased.

    Documented classes and functions should be linked to using :class: and :meth: respectively. Ensure the entire module path is used.

    Links to other pages should *preferably* use :ref: so references persist when files are moved.

    Use .. note:: and .. warning:: directives to emphasize an edge-case.

    Put breakout code snippets into a box using two colons ::.
