Put variables (e.g., gen_f or H) in between double ticks ``stuff here`` (no quotes)

Code or monospaced values that contain quotes should only use double-quotes ("stuff_here")

Documented classes and functions should be linked to using :class: and :meth: respectively. Ensure the entire module path is used.

Links to other pages should *preferably* use :ref:, so references persist even when files are moved.

Put short code in between double ticks ``stuff here`` (no quotes)

Put referenced file names in between double ticks ``stuff here`` (no quotes)

Put environment variables in between double ticks ``stuff here`` (no quotes)

Use .. note:: and .. warning:: directives

Put breakout code snippets into a box using two colons ::

No italics on text of links

Use italics for emphasis

Ensure parameter types, return types, and contents of :obj:`label` structures, are "resolvable" (importable/parsable by Python). If not, append to "nitpicky"

Ensure global types in docstrings match their builtin/typing class or name; "string" should be "str", "optional" should be "Optional"

"list of object" should be "List[object]"

Docstrings for parameters or fields should end with periods

Subsections should be Title Cased

"where" should be lowercased when describing variables in a formula or code sample

Use tabs to compare multiple approaches or categorize content

Use dropdowns for multiple long-content sections on the same page.
