.. dropdown:: **Example Compatible Packages**

  libEnsemble and the `Community Examples repository`_ include example generator
  functions for the following libraries:

  - APOSMM_ Asynchronously parallel optimization solver for finding multiple minima. Supported local optimization routines include:

    - DFO-LS_ Derivative-free solver for (bound constrained) nonlinear least-squares minimization
    - NLopt_ Library for nonlinear optimization, providing a common interface for various methods
    - `scipy.optimize`_ Open-source solvers for nonlinear problems, linear programming,
      constrained and nonlinear least-squares, root finding, and curve fitting.
    - `PETSc/TAO`_ Routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications

  - DEAP_ Distributed evolutionary algorithms
  - Distributed optimization methods for minimizing sums of convex functions. Methods include:

    - Primal-dual sliding (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00143).
    - Distributed gradient descent with gradient tracking (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11444).
    - Proximal sliding (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0919).

  - ECNoise_ Estimating Computational Noise in Numerical Simulations
  - Surmise_ Modular Bayesian calibration/inference framework
  - Tasmanian_ Toolkit for Adaptive Stochastic Modeling and Non-Intrusive ApproximatioN
  - VTMOP_ Fortran package for large-scale multiobjective multidisciplinary design optimization

  libEnsemble has also been used to coordinate many computationally expensive
  simulations. Select examples include:

  - OPAL_ Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library. (See this `IPAC manuscript`_.)
  - WarpX_ Advanced electromagnetic particle-in-cell code. (See example `WarpX + libE scripts`_.)
