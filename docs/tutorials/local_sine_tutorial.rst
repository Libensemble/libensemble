===================
Simple Introduction
===================

This tutorial demonstrates the capability to perform ensembles of
calculations in parallel using :doc:`libEnsemble<../introduction>`.

We recommend reading this brief :doc:`Overview<../overview_usecases>`.

For this tutorial, our generator will produce uniform randomly sampled
values, and our simulator will calculate the sine of each. By default we don't
need to write a new allocation function.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: 1. Getting started

        libEnsemble is written entirely in Python_. Let's make sure
        the correct version is installed.

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ python --version
            Python 3.9.0            # This should be >= 3.9

        .. _Python: https://www.python.org/

        For this tutorial, you need NumPy_ and (optionally)
        Matplotlib_ to visualize your results. Install libEnsemble and these other
        libraries with

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ pip install libensemble
            $ pip install matplotlib # Optional

        If your system doesn't allow you to perform these installations, try adding
        ``--user`` to the end of each command.

        .. _NumPy: https://www.numpy.org/
        .. _Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/

    .. tab-item:: 2. Generator

        Let's begin the coding portion of this tutorial by writing our generator function,
        or :ref:`gen_f<api_gen_f>`.

        An available libEnsemble worker will call this generator function with the
        following parameters:

            * :ref:`Input<funcguides-history>`: A selection of the History array,
              passed to the generator function in case the user wants to generate
              new values based on simulation outputs. Since our generator produces random
              numbers, it'll be ignored this time.

            * :ref:`persis_info<datastruct-persis-info>`: Dictionary with worker-specific
              information. In our case, this dictionary contains NumPy Random Stream objects
              for generating random numbers.

            * :ref:`gen_specs<datastruct-gen-specs>`: Dictionary with user-defined static fields and
              parameters. Customizable parameters such as lower and upper bounds and batch
              sizes are placed within the ``gen_specs["user"]`` dictionary, while input/output and other fields
              that libEnsemble needs to operate the generator are placed outside ``user``.

        Later on, we'll populate :class:`gen_specs<libensemble.specs.GenSpecs>` and ``persis_info`` when we initialize libEnsemble.

        For now, create a new Python file named ``generator.py``. Write the following:

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:
            :caption: examples/tutorials/simple_sine/tutorial_gen.py

            import numpy as np


            def gen_random_sample(Input, persis_info, gen_specs):
                # Pull out user parameters
                user_specs = gen_specs["user"]

                # Get lower and upper bounds
                lower = user_specs["lower"]
                upper = user_specs["upper"]

                # Determine how many values to generate
                num = len(lower)
                batch_size = user_specs["gen_batch_size"]

                # Create empty array of "batch_size" zeros. Array dtype should match "out" fields
                Output = np.zeros(batch_size, dtype=gen_specs["out"])

                # Set the "x" output field to contain random numbers, using random stream
                Output["x"] = persis_info["rand_stream"].uniform(lower, upper, (batch_size, num))

                # Send back our output and persis_info
                return Output, persis_info

        Our function creates ``batch_size`` random numbers uniformly distributed
        between the ``lower`` and ``upper`` bounds. A random stream
        from ``persis_info`` is used to generate these values, which are then placed
        into an output NumPy array that matches the dtype from ``gen_specs["out"]``.

        **Exercise**

        Write a simple generator function that instead produces random integers, using
        the ``numpy.random.Generator.integers(low, high, size)`` function.

        .. dropdown:: **Click Here for Solution**

            .. code-block:: python
                :linenos:

                import numpy as np


                def gen_random_ints(Input, persis_info, gen_specs, _):
                    user_specs = gen_specs["user"]
                    lower = user_specs["lower"]
                    upper = user_specs["upper"]
                    num = len(lower)
                    batch_size = user_specs["gen_batch_size"]

                    Output = np.zeros(batch_size, dtype=gen_specs["out"])
                    Output["x"] = persis_info["rand_stream"].integers(lower, upper, (batch_size, num))

                    return Output, persis_info

    .. tab-item:: 3. Simulator

        Next, we'll write our simulator function or :ref:`sim_f<api_sim_f>`. Simulator
        functions perform calculations based on values from the generator function.
        The only new parameter here is :ref:`sim_specs<datastruct-sim-specs>`, which
        serves a purpose similar to the :class:`gen_specs<libensemble.specs.GenSpecs>` dictionary.

        Create a new Python file named ``simulator.py``. Write the following:

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:
            :caption: examples/tutorials/simple_sine/tutorial_sim.py

            import numpy as np


            def sim_find_sine(Input, _, sim_specs):
                # Create an output array of a single zero
                Output = np.zeros(1, dtype=sim_specs["out"])

                # Set the zero to the sine of the Input value
                Output["y"] = np.sin(Input["x"])

                # Send back our output
                return Output

        Our simulator function is called by a worker for every work item produced by
        the generator function. This function calculates the sine of the passed value,
        and then returns it so the worker can store the result.

        **Exercise**

        Write a simple simulator function that instead calculates the *cosine* of a received
        value, using the ``numpy.cos(x)`` function.

        .. dropdown:: **Click Here for Solution**

            .. code-block:: python
                :linenos:

                import numpy as np


                def sim_find_cosine(Input, _, sim_specs):
                    Output = np.zeros(1, dtype=sim_specs["out"])

                    Output["y"] = np.cos(Input["x"])

                    return Output

    .. tab-item:: 4. Script

        Now lets write the script that configures our generator and simulator
        functions and starts libEnsemble.

        Create an empty Python file named ``calling_script.py``.
        In this file, we'll start by importing NumPy, libEnsemble's setup classes,
        and the generator and simulator functions we just created.

        In a class called :ref:`LibeSpecs<datastruct-libe-specs>` we'll
        specify the number of workers and the manager/worker intercommunication method.
        ``"local"``, refers to Python's multiprocessing.

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            import numpy as np
            from libensemble import Ensemble, LibeSpecs, SimSpecs, GenSpecs, ExitCriteria
            from generator import gen_random_sample
            from simulator import sim_find_sine

            libE_specs = LibeSpecs(nworkers=4, comms="local")

        We configure the settings and specifications for our ``sim_f`` and ``gen_f``
        functions in the :ref:`GenSpecs<datastruct-gen-specs>` and
        :ref:`SimSpecs<datastruct-sim-specs>` classes, which we saw previously
        being passed to our functions *as dictionaries*.
        These classes also describe to libEnsemble what inputs and outputs from those
        functions to expect.

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            gen_specs = GenSpecs(
                gen_f=gen_random_sample,  # Our generator function
                out=[("x", float, (1,))],  # gen_f output (name, type, size)
                user={
                    "lower": np.array([-3]),  # lower boundary for random sampling
                    "upper": np.array([3]),  # upper boundary for random sampling
                    "gen_batch_size": 5,  # number of x's gen_f generates per call
                },
            )

            sim_specs = SimSpecs(
                sim_f=sim_find_sine,  # Our simulator function
                inputs=["x"],  #  Input field names. "x" from gen_f output
                out=[("y", float)],  # sim_f output. "y" = sine("x")
            )

        We then specify the circumstances where
        libEnsemble should stop execution in :ref:`ExitCriteria<datastruct-exit-criteria>`.

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            exit_criteria = ExitCriteria(sim_max=80)  # Stop libEnsemble after 80 simulations

        Now we're ready to write our libEnsemble :doc:`libE<../programming_libE>`
        function call. This :ref:`H<funcguides-history>` is the final version of
        the history array. ``flag`` should be zero if no errors occur.

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            ensemble = Ensemble(libE_specs, sim_specs, gen_specs, exit_criteria)
            ensemble.add_random_streams()  # setup the random streams unique to each worker

            if __name__ == "__main__":  # Python-quirk required on macOS and windows
                ensemble.run()  # start the ensemble. Blocks until completion.

            history = ensemble.H  # start visualizing our results

            print([i for i in history.dtype.fields])  # (optional) to visualize our history array
            print(history)

        That's it! Now that these files are complete, we can run our simulation.

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ python calling_script.py

        If everything ran perfectly and you included the above print statements, you
        should get something similar to the following output (although the
        columns might be rearranged).

        .. code-block::

            ["y", "sim_started_time", "gen_worker", "sim_worker", "sim_started", "sim_ended", "x", "allocated", "sim_id", "gen_ended_time"]
            [(-0.37466051, 1.559+09, 2, 2,  True,  True, [-0.38403059],  True,  0, 1.559+09)
            (-0.29279634, 1.559+09, 2, 3,  True,  True, [-2.84444261],  True,  1, 1.559+09)
            ( 0.29358492, 1.559+09, 2, 4,  True,  True, [ 0.29797487],  True,  2, 1.559+09)
            (-0.3783986, 1.559+09, 2, 1,  True,  True, [-0.38806564],  True,  3, 1.559+09)
            (-0.45982062, 1.559+09, 2, 2,  True,  True, [-0.47779319],  True,  4, 1.559+09)
            ...

        In this arrangement, our output values are listed on the far left with the
        generated values being the fourth column from the right.

        Two additional log files should also have been created.
        ``ensemble.log`` contains debugging or informational logging output from
        libEnsemble, while ``libE_stats.txt`` contains a quick summary of all
        calculations performed.

        Here is graphed output using ``Matplotlib``, with entries colored by which
        worker performed the simulation:

        .. image:: ../images/sinex.png
            :alt: sine
            :align: center

        If you want to verify your results through plotting and installed Matplotlib
        earlier, copy and paste the following code into the bottom of your calling
        script and run ``python calling_script.py`` again

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

            colors = ["b", "g", "r", "y", "m", "c", "k", "w"]

            for i in range(1, nworkers + 1):
                worker_xy = np.extract(H["sim_worker"] == i, H)
                x = [entry.tolist()[0] for entry in worker_xy["x"]]
                y = [entry for entry in worker_xy["y"]]
                plt.scatter(x, y, label="Worker {}".format(i), c=colors[i - 1])

            plt.title("Sine calculations for a uniformly sampled random distribution")
            plt.xlabel("x")
            plt.ylabel("sine(x)")
            plt.legend(loc="lower right")
            plt.savefig("tutorial_sines.png")

        Each of these example files can be found in the repository in `examples/tutorials/simple_sine`_.

        **Exercise**

        Write a Calling Script with the following specifications:

        1. Set the generator function's lower and upper bounds to -6 and 6, respectively
        2. Increase the generator batch size to 10
        3. Set libEnsemble to stop execution after 160 *generations* using the ``gen_max`` option
        4. Print an error message if any errors occurred while libEnsemble was running

        .. dropdown:: **Click Here for Solution**

            .. code-block:: python
                :linenos:

                import numpy as np
                from libensemble import Ensemble, LibeSpecs, SimSpecs, GenSpecs, ExitCriteria
                from generator import gen_random_sample
                from simulator import sim_find_sine

                libE_specs = LibeSpecs(nworkers=4, comms="local")

                gen_specs = GenSpecs(
                    gen_f=gen_random_sample,  # Our generator function
                    out=[("x", float, (1,))],  # gen_f output (name, type, size)
                    user={
                        "lower": np.array([-6]),  # lower boundary for random sampling
                        "upper": np.array([6]),  # upper boundary for random sampling
                        "gen_batch_size": 10,  # number of x's gen_f generates per call
                    },
                )

                sim_specs = SimSpecs(
                    sim_f=sim_find_sine,  # Our simulator function
                    inputs=["x"],  #  Input field names. "x" from gen_f output
                    out=[("y", float)],  # sim_f output. "y" = sine("x")
                )

                ensemble = Ensemble(libE_specs, sim_specs, gen_specs, exit_criteria)
                ensemble.add_random_streams()
                ensemble.run()

                if ensemble.flag != 0:
                    print("Oh no! An error occurred!")

    .. tab-item:: 5. Next steps

        **libEnsemble with MPI**

        MPI_ is a standard interface for parallel computing, implemented in libraries
        such as MPICH_ and used at extreme scales. MPI potentially allows libEnsemble's
        processes to be distributed over multiple nodes and works in some
        circumstances where Python's multiprocessing does not. In this section, we'll
        explore modifying the above code to use MPI instead of multiprocessing.

        We recommend the MPI distribution MPICH_ for this tutorial, which can be found
        for a variety of systems here_. You also need mpi4py_, which can be installed
        with ``pip install mpi4py``. If you'd like to use a specific version or
        distribution of MPI instead of MPICH, configure mpi4py with that MPI at
        installation with ``MPICC=<path/to/MPI_C_compiler> pip install mpi4py`` If this
        doesn't work, try appending ``--user`` to the end of the command. See the
        mpi4py_ docs for more information.

        Verify that MPI has been installed correctly with ``mpirun --version``.

        **Modifying the script**

        Only a few changes are necessary to make our code MPI-compatible. Note the following:

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            libE_specs = LibeSpecs()  # class will autodetect MPI runtime

        So that only one process executes the graphing and printing portion of our code,
        modify the bottom of the calling script like this:

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            ...
            ensemble = Ensemble(libE_specs, sim_specs, gen_specs, exit_criteria)
            ensemble.add_random_streams()
            ensemble.run()

            if ensemble.is_manager:  # only True on rank 0
                H = ensemble.H
                print([i for i in H.dtype.fields])
                print(H)

                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

                colors = ["b", "g", "r", "y", "m", "c", "k", "w"]

                for i in range(1, nworkers + 1):
                    worker_xy = np.extract(H["sim_worker"] == i, H)
                    x = [entry.tolist()[0] for entry in worker_xy["x"]]
                    y = [entry for entry in worker_xy["y"]]
                    plt.scatter(x, y, label="Worker {}".format(i), c=colors[i - 1])

                plt.title("Sine calculations for a uniformly sampled random distribution")
                plt.xlabel("x")
                plt.ylabel("sine(x)")
                plt.legend(loc="lower right")
                plt.savefig("tutorial_sines.png")

        With these changes in place, our libEnsemble code can be run with MPI by

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ mpirun -n 5 python calling_script.py

        where ``-n 5`` tells ``mpirun`` to produce five processes, one of which will be
        the manager process with the libEnsemble manager and the other four will run
        libEnsemble workers.

This tutorial is only a tiny demonstration of the parallelism capabilities of
libEnsemble. libEnsemble has been developed primarily to support research on
High-Performance computers, with potentially hundreds of workers performing
calculations simultaneously. Please read our
:doc:`platform guides <../platforms/platforms_index>` for introductions to using
libEnsemble on many such machines.

libEnsemble's Executors can launch non-Python user applications and simulations across
allocated compute resources. Try out this feature with a more-complicated
libEnsemble use-case within our
:doc:`Electrostatic Forces tutorial <./executor_forces_tutorial>`.
