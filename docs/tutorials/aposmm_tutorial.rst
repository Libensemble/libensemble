Parallel Optimization with APOSMM
=================================

This tutorial demonstrates libEnsemble's capability to identify multiple minima
of simulation output using the built-in :doc:`APOSMM<../examples/aposmm>`
(Asynchronously Parallel Optimization Solver for finding Multiple Minima)
:ref:`gen_f<api_gen_f>`. In this tutorial, we'll create a simple
simulation :ref:`sim_f<api_sim_f>` that defines a function with
multiple minima, then write a libEnsemble calling script that imports APOSMM and
parameterizes it to check for minima over a domain of outputs from our ``sim_f``.

Six-Hump Camel Simulation Function
----------------------------------

Describing APOSMM's operations is simpler with a given function on which to
depict evaluations. We'll use the `Six-Hump Camel function`_, known to have six
global minima. A sample space of this function, containing all minima, appears
below:

    .. image:: ../images/basic_6hc.png
        :alt: Six-Hump Camel
        :scale: 60
        :align: center

Create a new Python file named ``six_hump_camel.py``. This will be our
``sim_f``, incorporating the above function. Write the following:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import numpy as np


    def six_hump_camel(H, _, sim_specs):
        """Six-Hump Camel sim_f."""

        batch = len(H["x"])  # Num evaluations each sim_f call.
        H_o = np.zeros(batch, dtype=sim_specs["out"])  # Define output array H

        for i, x in enumerate(H["x"]):
            H_o["f"][i] = three_hump_camel_func(x)  # Function evaluations placed into H

        return H_o


    def six_hump_camel_func(x):
        """Six-Hump Camel function definition"""
        x1 = x[0]
        x2 = x[1]
        term1 = (4 - 2.1 * x1**2 + (x1**4) / 3) * x1**2
        term2 = x1 * x2
        term3 = (-4 + 4 * x2**2) * x2**2

        return term1 + term2 + term3

APOSMM Operations
-----------------

APOSMM coordinates multiple local optimization runs starting from a collection
of sample points. These local optimization runs occur concurrently,
and can incorporate a variety of optimization methods, including from NLopt_,
`PETSc/TAO`_, SciPy_, or other external scripts.

Before APOSMM can start local optimization runs, some number of uniformly
sampled points must be evaluated (if no prior simulation evaluations are
provided). User-requested sample points can also be provided to APOSMM:

    .. image:: ../images/sampling_6hc.png
        :alt: Six-Hump Camel Sampling
        :scale: 60
        :align: center

Specifically, APOSMM will begin local optimization runs from evaluated points that
don't have points with smaller function values nearby (within a threshold
``r_k``). For the above example, after APOSMM receives the evaluations of the
uniformly sampled points, it will begin at most ``max_active_runs``  local
optimization runs.

As function values are returned to APOSMM, APOSMM gives them to each local
optimization run in order to generate the next point(s); these are returned to
the manager to be evaluated by the simulation routine. As runs complete (a
minimum is found, or some termination criteria for the local optimization run
is satisfied),
additional local optimization runs may be started or additional uniformly
sampled points may be evaluated. This continues until a ``STOP_TAG`` is sent by
the manager, for example when the budget of simulation evaluations has been
exhausted, or when a sufficiently "good" simulation output has been observed.

    .. image:: ../images/localopt_6hc.png
        :alt: Six-Hump Camel Local Optimization Points
        :scale: 60
        :align: center

Throughout, generated and evaluated points are appended to the
:ref:`History<funcguides-history>` array, with the field
``"local_pt"`` being ``True`` if the point is part of a local optimization run,
and ``"local_min"`` being ``True`` if the point has been ruled a local minimum.

APOSMM Persistence
------------------

The most recent version of APOSMM included with libEnsemble is referred to as
Persistent APOSMM. Unlike most other user functions that are initiated and
completed by workers multiple times based on allocation, a single worker process
initiates APOSMM so that it "persists" and keeps running over the course of the
entire libEnsemble routine. APOSMM begins its own parallel evaluations and
communicates points back and forth with the manager, which are then given to
workers and evaluated by simulation routines.

In practice, since a single worker becomes "persistent" for APOSMM, users must
ensure that enough workers or MPI ranks are initiated to
support libEnsemble's manager, a persistent worker to run APOSMM, and
simulation routines. The following::

    mpiexec -n 3 python my_aposmm_routine.py

results in only one worker process available to perform simulation routines.

Calling Script
--------------

Create a new Python file named ``my_first_aposmm.py``. Start by importing NumPy,
libEnsemble routines, APOSMM, our ``sim_f``, and a specialized allocation
function:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import numpy as np

    from six_hump_camel import six_hump_camel

    from libensemble.libE import libE
    from libensemble.gen_funcs.persistent_aposmm import aposmm
    from libensemble.alloc_funcs.persistent_aposmm_alloc import persistent_aposmm_alloc
    from libensemble.tools import parse_args, add_unique_random_streams

This allocation function starts a single Persistent APOSMM routine and provides
``sim_f`` output for points requested by APOSMM. Points can be sampled points
or points from local optimization runs.

APOSMM supports a wide variety of external optimizers. The following statements
set optimizer settings to ``"scipy"`` to indicate to APOSMM which optimization
method to use, and help prevent unnecessary imports or package installations:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import libensemble.gen_funcs

    libensemble.gen_funcs.rc.aposmm_optimizers = "scipy"

Set up :doc:`parse_args()<../utilities>`,
our :doc:`sim_specs<../data_structures/sim_specs>`,
:doc:`gen_specs<../data_structures/gen_specs>`,
and :doc:`alloc_specs<../data_structures/alloc_specs>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    nworkers, is_manager, libE_specs, _ = parse_args()

    sim_specs = {
        "sim_f": six_hump_camel,  # Simulation function
        "in": ["x"],  # Accepts "x" values
        "out": [("f", float)],  # Returns f(x) values
    }

    gen_out = [
        ("x", float, 2),  # Produces "x" values
        ("x_on_cube", float, 2),  # "x" values scaled to unit cube
        ("sim_id", int),  # Produces sim_id's for History array indexing
        ("local_min", bool),  # Is a point a local minimum?
        ("local_pt", bool),  # Is a point from a local opt run?
    ]

    gen_specs = {
        "gen_f": aposmm,  # APOSMM generator function
        "persis_in": ["f"] + [n[0] for n in gen_out],
        "out": gen_out,  # Output defined like above dict
        "user": {
            "initial_sample_size": 100,  # Random sample 100 points to start
            "localopt_method": "scipy_Nelder-Mead",
            "opt_return_codes": [0],  # Status integers specific to localopt_method
            "max_active_runs": 6,  # Occur in parallel
            "lb": np.array([-2, -1]),  # Lower bound of search domain
            "ub": np.array([2, 1]),  # Upper bound of search domain
        },
    }

    alloc_specs = {"alloc_f": persistent_aposmm_alloc}

``gen_specs["user"]`` fields above that are required for APOSMM are:

    * ``"lb"`` - Search domain lower bound
    * ``"ub"`` - Search domain upper bound
    * ``"localopt_method"`` - Chosen local optimization method
    * ``"initial_sample_size"`` - Number of uniformly sampled points generated
      before local optimization runs.
    * ``"opt_return_codes"`` - A list of integers that local optimization
      methods return when a minimum is detected. SciPy's Nelder-Mead returns 0,
      but other methods (not used in this tutorial) return 1.

Also note the following:

    * ``gen_specs["in"]`` is empty. For other ``gen_f``'s this defines what
      fields to give to the ``gen_f`` when called, but here APOSMM's
      ``alloc_f`` defines those fields.
    * ``"x_on_cube"`` in ``gen_specs["out"]``. APOSMM works internally on
      ``"x"`` values scaled to the unit cube. To avoid back-and-forth scaling
      issues, both types of ``"x"``'s are communicated back, even though the
      simulation will likely use ``"x"`` values. (APOSMM performs handshake to
      ensure that the ``x_on_cube`` that was given to be evaluated is the same
      the one that is given back.)
    * ``"sim_id"`` in ``gen_specs["out"]``. APOSMM produces points in its
      local History array that it will need to update later, and can best
      reference those points (and avoid a search) if APOSMM produces the IDs
      itself, instead of libEnsemble.

Other options and configurations for APOSMM can be found in the
APOSMM :doc:`API reference<../examples/aposmm>`.

Set :ref:`exit_criteria<datastruct-exit-criteria>` so libEnsemble knows
when to complete, and :ref:`persis_info<datastruct-persis-info>` for
random sampling seeding:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    exit_criteria = {"sim_max": 2000}
    persis_info = add_unique_random_streams({}, nworkers + 1)

Finally, add statements to :doc:`initiate libEnsemble<../libe_module>`, and quickly
check calculated minima:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    H, persis_info, flag = libE(sim_specs, gen_specs, exit_criteria, persis_info, alloc_specs, libE_specs)
    if is_manager:
        print("Minima:", H[np.where(H["local_min"])]["x"])

Final Setup, Run, and Output
----------------------------

If you haven't already, install SciPy so APOSMM can access the required
optimization method::

    pip install scipy

Finally, run this libEnsemble / APOSMM optimization routine with the following::

    python my_first_aposmm.py --comms local --nworkers 4

Please note that one worker will be "persistent" for APOSMM for the duration of
the routine.

After a couple seconds, the output should resemble the following::

    [0] libensemble.libE (MANAGER_WARNING):
    *******************************************************************************
    User generator script will be creating sim_id.
    Take care to do this sequentially.
    Also, any information given back for existing sim_id values will be overwritten!
    So everything in gen_specs["out"] should be in gen_specs["in"]!
    *******************************************************************************

    Minima: [[ 0.08993295 -0.71265804]
     [ 1.70360676 -0.79614982]
     [-1.70368421  0.79606073]
     [-0.08988064  0.71270945]
     [-1.60699361 -0.56859108]
     [ 1.60713962  0.56869567]]

The first section labeled ``MANAGER_WARNING`` is a default libEnsemble warning
for generator functions that create ``sim_id``'s, like APOSMM. It does not
indicate a failure.

The local minima for the Six-Hump Camel simulation function as evaluated by
APOSMM with libEnsemble should be listed directly below the warning.

Please see the API reference :doc:`here<../examples/aposmm>` for
more APOSMM configuration options and other information.

Each of these example files can be found in the repository in `examples/tutorials/aposmm`_.

Applications
------------

APOSMM is not limited to evaluating minima from pure Python simulation functions.
Many common libEnsemble use-cases involve using
libEnsemble's :doc:`MPI Executor<../executor/overview>` to launch user
applications with parameters requested by APOSMM, then evaluate their output using
APOSMM, and repeat until minima are identified. A currently supported example
can be found in libEnsemble's `WarpX Scaling Test`_.
