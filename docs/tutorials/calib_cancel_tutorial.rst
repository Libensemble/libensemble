Borehole Calibration with Selective Simulation Cancellation

Introduction - Calibration with libEnsemble and a Regression Model
------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial demonstrates libEnsemble's capability to selectively cancel pending
simulations based on instructions from a calibration Generator Function.
This capability is desirable, especially when evaluations are expensive, since
compute resources may then be more effectively applied towards critical evaluations.

For a somewhat different approach than libEnsemble's :doc:`other tutorials<tutorials>`,
we'll emphasize the settings, functions, and data fields within the calling script,
:ref:`persistent generator<persistent-gens>`, Manager, and :ref:`sim_f<api_sim_f>`
that make this capability possible, rather than outlining a step-by-step process.

The libEnsemble regression test ``test_persistent_surmise_calib.py`` demonstrates
cancellation of pending simulations, while the ``test_persistent_surmise_killsims.py``
test demonstrates libEnsemble's capability to also kill running simulations that
have been marked as cancelled.

Overview of the Calibration Problem
-----------------------------------

The generator function featured in this tutorial can be found in
``gen_funcs/persistent_surmise_calib.py`` and uses the `surmise`_ library for its
calibration surrogate model interface. The surmise library uses the  "PCGPwM"
emulation method in this example.

Say there is a computer model :math:`f(\theta, x)` to be calibrated.  To calibrate
is to find some parameter :math:`\theta_0` such that :math:`f(\theta_0, x)` closely
resembles data collected from a physical experiment.  For example, a (simple)
physical experiment may involve dropping a ball at different heights to study the
gravitational constant, and the corresponding computer model could be the set of
differential equations that governs the drop. In a case where the computation of
the computer model is relatively expensive, we employ a fast surrogate model to
approximate the model and to inform good parameters to test next.  Here the computer
model :math:`f(\theta, x)` is accessible only through performing :ref:`sim_f<api_sim_f>`
evaluations.

As a convenience for testing, the ``observed`` data values are modelled by calling the ``sim_f``
for the known true theta, which in this case is the center of a unit hypercube. These values
are therefore stored at the start of libEnsemble's
main :doc:`History array<../history_output_logging>` array, and have associated ``sim_id``'s.

The generator function ``gen_f`` then samples an initial batch of parameters
:math:`(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n)` and constructs a surrogate model.

For illustration, the initial batch of evaluations are arranged in the following sense:

.. math::

    \newcommand{\T}{\mathsf{T}}
    \mathbf{f} = \begin{pmatrix} f(\theta_1)^\T \\ \vdots \\ f(\theta_n)^\T \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix} f(\theta_1, x_1) & \ldots & f(\theta_1, x_m) \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots
    \\ f(\theta_n, x_1) & \ldots & f(\theta_n, x_m) \end{pmatrix}.

The surrogate then generates (suggests) new parameters for ``sim_f`` evaluations,
so the number of parameters :math:`n` grows as more evaluations are scheduled and performed.
As more evaluations are performed and received by ``gen_f``, the surrogate evolves and
suggests parameters closer to :math:`\theta_0` with uncertainty estimates.
The calibration can be terminated when either ``gen_f`` determines it has found
:math:`\theta_0` with some tolerance in the surrounding uncertainty, or computational
resource runs out.  At termination, the generator exits and returns, initiating the
shutdown of the libEnsemble routine.

The following is a pseudocode overview of the generator. Functions directly from
the calibration library used within the generator function have the ``calib:`` prefix.
Helper functions defined to improve the data received by the calibration library by
interfacing with libEnsemble have the ``libE:`` prefix. All other statements are
workflow logic or persistent generator helper functions like ``send`` or ``receive``::

    1    libE: calculate observation values and first batch
    2    while STOP_signal not received:
    3        receive: evaluated points
    4        unpack points into 2D Theta x Point structures
    5        if new model condition:
    6            calib: construct new model
    7        else:
    8            wait to receive more points
    9        if some condition:
    10           calib: generate new thetas from model
    11           calib: if error threshold reached:
    12               exit loop - done
    13           send: new points to be evaluated
    14       if any sent points must be obviated:
    15           libE: mark points with cancel request
    16               send: points with cancel request

Point Cancellation Requests and Dedicated Fields
------------------------------------------------

While the generator loops and updates the model based on returned
points from simulations, it detects conditionally if any new Thetas should be generated
from the model, simultaneously evaluating if any *pending* simulations ought to be
cancelled ("obviated"). If so, the generator then calls ``cancel_columns()``::

    if select_condition(pending):
        new_theta, info = select_next_theta(step_add_theta, cal, emu, pending, n_explore_theta)
        ...
        c_obviate = info["obviatesugg"]  # suggested
        if len(c_obviate) > 0:
            cancel_columns(obs_offset, c_obviate, n_x, pending, ps)

``obs_offset`` is an offset that excludes the observations when mapping points in surmise
data structures to ``sim_id``'s, ``c_obviate`` is a selection
of columns to cancel, ``n_x`` is the number of ``x`` values, and ``pending`` is used
to check that points marked for cancellation have not already returned. ``ps`` is the
instantiation of the *PersistentSupport* class that is set up for persistent generators, and
provides an interface for communication with the manager.

Within ``cancel_columns()``, each column in ``c_obviate`` is iterated over, and if a
point is ``pending`` and thus has not yet been evaluated by a simulation,
its ``sim_id`` is appended to a list to be sent to the Manager for cancellation.
Cancellation is requested using the helper function ``request_cancel_sim_ids`` provided
by the *PersistentSupport* class.  Each of these helper functions is described
:ref:`here<p_gen_routines>`. The entire ``cancel_columns()`` routine is listed below:

.. code-block:: python

    def cancel_columns(obs_offset, c, n_x, pending, ps):
        """Cancel columns"""
        sim_ids_to_cancel = []
        columns = np.unique(c)
        for c in columns:
            col_offset = c * n_x
            for i in range(n_x):
                sim_id_cancel = obs_offset + col_offset + i
                if pending[i, c]:
                    sim_ids_to_cancel.append(sim_id_cancel)
                    pending[i, c] = 0

        ps.request_cancel_sim_ids(sim_ids_to_cancel)

In future calls to the allocation function by the manager, points that would have
been distributed for simulation work but are now marked with "cancel_requested" will not
be processed. The manager will send kill signals to workers that are already processing
cancelled points. These signals can be caught and acted on by the user ``sim_f``; otherwise
they will be ignored.

Allocation function
-------------------

The allocation function used in this example is the *only_persistent_gens* function in the
*start_only_persistent* module. The calling script passes the following specification:

.. code-block:: python

    alloc_specs = {
        "alloc_f": alloc_f,
        "user": {
            "init_sample_size": init_sample_size,
            "async_return": True,
            "active_recv_gen": True,
        },
    }

**async_return** tells the allocation function to return results to the generator as soon
as they come back from evaluation (once the initial sample is complete).

**init_sample_size** gives the size of the initial sample that is batch returned to the gen.
This is calculated from other parameters in the calling script.

**active_recv_gen** allows the persistent generator to handle irregular communications (see below).

By default, workers (including persistent workers), are only
allocated work when they're in an :ref:`idle or non-active state<funcguides-workerarray>`.
However, since this generator must asynchronously update its model, the worker
running this generator remains in an *active receive* state, until it becomes
non-persistent. This means both the manager and persistent worker (generator in
this case) must be prepared for irregular sending/receiving of data.

.. Manager - Cancellation, History Updates, and Allocation
.. -------------------------------------------------------
..
.. Between routines to call the allocation function and distribute allocated work
.. to each Worker, the Manager selects points from the History array that are:
..
..     1) Marked as ``"sim_started"`` by the allocation function
..     2) Marked with ``"cancel_requested"`` by the generator
..     3) *Not* been marked as ``"sim_ended"`` by the Manager
..     4) *Not* been marked with ``"kill_sent"`` by the Manager
..
.. If any points match these characteristics, the Workers that are processing these
.. points are sent ``STOP`` tags and a kill signal. ``"kill_sent"``
.. is set to ``True`` for each of these points in the Manager's History array. During
.. the subsequent :ref:`start_only_persistent<start_only_persistent_label>` allocation
.. function calls, any points in the Manager's History array that have ``"cancel_requested"``
.. as ``True`` are not allocated::
..
..     task_avail = ~H["sim_started"] & ~H["cancel_requested"]
..
.. This ``alloc_f`` also can prioritize allocating points that have
.. higher ``"priority"`` values from the ``gen_f`` values in the local History array::
..
..     # Loop through available simulation workers
..     for i in support.avail_worker_ids(persistent=False):
..
..         if np.any(task_avail):
..             if "priority" in H.dtype.fields:
..                 priorities = H["priority"][task_avail]
..                 if alloc_specs["user"].get("give_all_with_same_priority"):
..                     indexes = (priorities == np.max(priorities))
..                 else:
..                     indexes = np.argmax(priorities)
..             else:
..                 indexes = 0

.. Simulator - Receiving Kill Signal and Cancelling Tasks
.. ------------------------------------------------------
..
.. Within the Simulation Function, the :doc:`Executor<../executor/overview>`
.. is used to launch simulations based on points from the generator,
.. and then enters a routine to loop and check for signals from the Manager::
..
..     def subproc_borehole_func(H, subp_opts, libE_info):
..         sim_id = libE_info["H_rows"][0]
..         H_o = np.zeros(H.shape[0], dtype=sim_specs["out"])
..         ...
..         exctr = Executor.executor
..         task = exctr.submit(app_name="borehole", app_args=args, stdout="out.txt", stderr="err.txt")
..         calc_status = polling_loop(exctr, task, sim_id)
..
.. where ``polling_loop()`` resembles the following::
..
..     def polling_loop(exctr, task, sim_id):
..         calc_status = UNSET_TAG
..         poll_interval = 0.01
..
..         # Poll task for finish and poll manager for kill signals
..         while(not task.finished):
..             exctr.manager_poll()
..             if exctr.manager_signal == MAN_SIGNAL_KILL:
..                 task.kill()
..                 calc_status = MAN_SIGNAL_KILL
..                 break
..             else:
..                 task.poll()
..                 time.sleep(poll_interval)
..
..         if task.state == "FAILED":
..             calc_status = TASK_FAILED
..
..         return calc_status
..
.. While the launched task isn't finished, the simulator function periodically polls
.. both the task's statuses and for signals from the manager via
.. the :ref:`executor.manager_poll()<manager_poll_label>` function.
.. Immediately after ``exctr.manager_signal`` is confirmed as ``MAN_SIGNAL_KILL``, the current
.. task is killed and the function returns with the
.. ``MAN_SIGNAL_KILL`` :doc:`calc_status<../data_structures/calc_status>`.
.. This status will be logged in ``libE_stats.txt``.

Calling Script - Reading Results
--------------------------------

Within the libEnsemble calling script, once the main :doc:`libE()<../libe_module>`
function call has returned, it's a simple enough process to view the History rows
that were marked as cancelled::

    H, persis_info, flag = libE(sim_specs, gen_specs,
                                exit_criteria, persis_info,
                                alloc_specs=alloc_specs,
                                libE_specs=libE_specs)

    if is_manager:
        print("Cancelled sims", H["cancel_requested"])

Here's an example graph showing the relationship between scheduled, cancelled (obviated),
failed, and completed simulations requested by the ``gen_f``. Notice that for each
batch of scheduled simulations, most either complete or fail but the rest are
successfully obviated:

    .. image:: ../images/gen_v_fail_or_cancel.png
      :width: 600
      :alt: surmise_sample_graph
      :align: center

Please see the ``test_persistent_surmise_calib.py`` regression test for an example
routine using the surmise calibration generator.
The associated simulation function and allocation function are included in
``sim_funcs/surmise_test_function.py`` and ``alloc_funcs/start_only_persistent.py`` respectively.

Using cancellations to kill running simulations
------------------------------------------------

If a generated point is cancelled by the generator before it has been given to a worker for evaluation,
then it will never be given. If it has already returned from simulation, then results can be returned,
but the ``cancel_requested`` field remains as True. However, if the simulation is running when the manager
receives the cancellation request, a kill signal will be sent to the worker. This can be caught and acted upon
by a user function, otherwise it will be ignored. To demonstrate this, the test ``test_persistent_surmise_killsims.py``
captures and processes this signal from the manager.

In order to do this, a compiled version of the borehole function is launched by ``sim_funcs/borehole_kills.py``
via the :doc:`Executor<../executor/overview>`. As the borehole application used here is serial, we use the
:doc:`Executor base class<../executor/executor>` rather than the commonly used :doc:`MPIExecutor<../executor/mpi_executor>`
class. The base Executor submit routine simply sub-processes a serial application in-place. After the initial
sample batch of evaluations has been processed, an artificial delay is added to the sub-processed borehole to
allow time to receive the kill signal and terminate the application. Killed simulations will be reported at
the end of the test. As this is dependent on timing, the number of killed simulations will vary between runs.
This test is added simply to demonstrate the killing of running simulations and thus uses a reduced number of evaluations.
