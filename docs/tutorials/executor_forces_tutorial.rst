==================================
Executor with Electrostatic Forces
==================================

This tutorial highlights libEnsemble's capability to execute
and monitor external scripts or user applications within simulation or generator
functions using the :doc:`executor<../executor/overview>`. In this tutorial,
our calling script registers a compiled executable that simulates
electrostatic forces between a collection of particles. The ``sim_f``
routine then launches and polls this executable.

It is possible to use ``subprocess`` calls from Python to issue
commands such as ``jsrun`` or ``aprun`` to run applications. Unfortunately,
hard-coding such commands within user scripts isn't portable.
Furthermore, many systems like Argonne's :doc:`Theta<../platforms/theta>` do not
allow libEnsemble to submit additional tasks from the compute nodes. On these
systems a proxy launch mechanism (such as Balsam) is required.
libEnsemble's Executor was developed to directly address such issues.

Getting Started
---------------

The simulation source code ``forces.c`` can be obtained directly from the
libEnsemble repository here_.

Assuming MPI and its C compiler ``mpicc`` are available, compile
``forces.c`` into an executable (``forces.x``) with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mpicc -O3 -o forces.x forces.c -lm

Calling Script
--------------

Let's begin by writing our calling script to parameterize our simulation and
generation functions and call libEnsemble. Create a Python file containing:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 22

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import os
    import numpy as np
    from forces_simf import run_forces  # Sim func from current dir

    from libensemble.libE import libE
    from libensemble.gen_funcs.sampling import uniform_random_sample
    from libensemble.tools import parse_args
    from libensemble.executors.mpi_executor import MPIExecutor

    nworkers, is_manager, libE_specs, _ = parse_args()  # Convenience function

    # Initialize executor instance
    exctr = MPIExecutor()

    # Create empty simulation input directory
    if not os.path.isdir('./sim'):
        os.mkdir('./sim')

    # Register simulation executable with executor
    sim_app = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'forces.x')
    exctr.register_app(full_path=sim_app, app_name='forces')

On line 4 we import our not-yet-written ``sim_f``. We also import necessary
libEnsemble components and some :doc:`convenience functions<../utilities>`.
With a call to the ``parse_args()`` convenience function, our script detects the
number of workers ``nworkers``, a boolean determining if the process is the manager
process ``is_manager``, and a default :ref:`libE_specs<datastruct-libe-specs>`

Next we define our Executor class instance. This instance can be customized
with many of the settings defined :doc:`here<../executor/mpi_executor>`.
We'll register our simulation with the executor and use the same
instance within our simulation function.

Next define the :ref:`sim_specs<datastruct-sim-specs>` and
:ref:`gen_specs<datastruct-gen-specs>` data structures. Recall that these
are used to specify to libEnsemble what input/output fields to expect, and also
to parameterize function instances without hard-coding:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # State the simulation function, its arguments, output, and parameters (and their sizes)
    sim_specs = {'sim_f': run_forces,         # simulation function, imported above
                 'in': ['x'],                 # Name of inputs from History array
                 'out': [('energy', float)],  # Name, type of output from simulation function
                 'user': {'cores': 2,         # Additional User parameters
                          'sim_particles': 1e3,
                          'sim_timesteps': 5,
                          'sim_kill_minutes': 10.0,
                          'particle_variance': 0.2,
                          'kill_rate': 0.5}
                 }

    # State the gen_f, its arguments, output, and necessary parameters.
    gen_specs = {'gen_f': uniform_random_sample,  # Generator function
                 'in': ['sim_id'],                # Generator input
                 'out': [('x', float, (1,))],     # Name, type and size of data from gen_f
                 'user': {'lb': np.array([0]),            # User parameters for gen_f
                          'ub': np.array([32767]),
                          'gen_batch_size': 1000,
                          'batch_mode': True,
                          'num_active_gens': 1,
                          }
                 }

Our generation function will generate random seeds to use within
each simulation function call.

libEnsemble can perform every simulation instance (within the ensemble) in a
separate directory for organization and potential I/O benefits. In this example,
libEnsemble copies the source directory ``./sim`` and its contents to create these
simulation directories. These input/output directories are highly customizable,
using many of the settings described :ref:`here<output_dirs>`.

After additional settings and configuring our ``exit_criteria``, we call libEnsemble
using the primary :doc:`libE()<../libe_module>` routine:

 .. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    libE_specs['save_every_k_gens'] = 1000  # Save every K steps
    libE_specs['sim_input_dir'] = './sim'   # Sim input dir to be copied for each worker

    exit_criteria = {'sim_max': 8}

    persis_info = {}

    H, persis_info, flag = libE(sim_specs, gen_specs, exit_criteria,
                                persis_info=persis_info, libE_specs=libE_specs)

Exercise
^^^^^^^^

This may take some additional browsing of the docs to complete.

Write an alternative Calling Script similar to above, but with the following differences:

 1. Override the MPIExecutor's detected MPI runner with ``'openmpi'``.
 2. Set the output ensemble directory to be stored in ``/scratch``, then copied back to the starting directory on completion.
 3. Set the libEnsemble logger to print DEBUG messages.
 4. Save the History array and ``persis_info`` to files once libEnsemble completes.
 5. Simplify our Calling Script by using the ``yaml`` interface.

Simulation Function
-------------------

Our simulation function is where we'll use libEnsemble's executor to configure and submit
our application for execution. We'll poll this task's state while
it runs, and once we've detected it has finished we'll send any results or
exit statuses back to the manager.

Create another Python file named ``forces_simf.py`` containing some imports
and utility functions for starters:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import os
    import time
    import numpy as np

    from libensemble.executors.executor import Executor
    from libensemble.message_numbers import WORKER_DONE, WORKER_KILL, TASK_FAILED

    MAX_SEED = 32767

    def perturb(particles, seed, max_fraction):
        """Modify particle count"""
        seed_fraction = seed/MAX_SEED
        max_delta = particles * max_fraction
        delta = seed_fraction * max_delta
        delta = delta - max_delta/2  # translate so -/+
        new_particles = particles + delta
        return int(new_particles)

    def read_last_line(filepath):
        """Read last line of statfile"""
        try:
            with open(filepath, 'rb') as fh:
                line = fh.readlines()[-1].decode().rstrip()
        except Exception:
            line = ""  # In case file is empty or not yet created
        return line

Next let's write the body of the simulation function. We'll write the function definition,
extract our parameters from ``sim_specs``, define a random seed, and use
``perturb()`` to randomize our particle counts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def run_forces(H, persis_info, sim_specs, libE_info):
        calc_status = 0

        x = H['x']
        sim_particles = sim_specs['user']['sim_particles']
        sim_timesteps = sim_specs['user']['sim_timesteps']
        time_limit = sim_specs['user']['sim_kill_minutes'] * 60.0

        cores = sim_specs['user'].get('cores', None)
        kill_rate = sim_specs['user'].get('kill_rate', 0)
        particle_variance = sim_specs['user'].get('particle_variance', 0)

        seed = int(np.rint(x[0][0]))

        # To give a random variance of work-load
        sim_particles = perturb(sim_particles, seed, particle_variance)

Next we will fetch our Executor and submit our registered application for
execution.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

        # Fetches *previously parameterized* Executor
        exctr = Executor.executor

        # Arguments for our registered simulation
        args = str(int(sim_particles)) + ' ' + str(sim_timesteps) + ' ' + str(seed) + ' ' + str(kill_rate)

        # Submit our simulation for execution.
        task = exctr.submit(app_name='forces', num_procs=cores, app_args=args,
                            stdout='out.txt', stderr='err.txt', wait_on_start=True)

In each executor ``submit()`` routine, we specify the registered application,
optionally the number of MPI processes to run the task with, additional
arguments for the simulation code, and files for ``stdout`` and ``stderr``
output. The ``wait_on_start`` argument causes this statement to block until the
application is confirmed running. See the :doc:`docs<../executor/mpi_executor>`
for more information about these and other options.

The rest of our simulation function polls the :ref:`Task<task_tag>`'s
dynamically updated attributes for its status, determines if a successful
run occurred after the task completes, then formats and returns the output data
to the manager.

We can poll the task and kill it if the output file contains some value or if
the task's runtime exceeds the time limit:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

        # Stat file to check for bad runs
        statfile = 'forces.stat'
        filepath = os.path.join(task.workdir, statfile)
        line = None

        poll_interval = 1
        while not task.finished :
            line = read_last_line(filepath)  # Parse some output from the task
            if line == "kill":
                task.kill()
            elif task.runtime > time_limit:
                task.kill()
            else:
                time.sleep(poll_interval)
                task.poll()                   # updates the task's attributes

Once our task finishes, adjust ``calc_status`` (our "exit code").

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

        if task.finished:
            if task.state == 'FINISHED':
                calc_status = WORKER_DONE
                if read_last_line(filepath) == "kill":
                    print("Warning: Task complete but marked bad (kill flag in forces.stat)")
            elif task.state == 'FAILED':
                calc_status = TASK_FAILED
            elif task.state == 'USER_KILLED':
                calc_status = WORKER_KILL
            else:
                print("Warning: Task {} in unknown state {}. Error code {}".format(task.name, task.state, task.errcode))

Load output data from our task, initialize an output NumPy array with that data,
then return it, ``persis_info`` (unused in our example but required by the interface),
and ``calc_status``:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

        time.sleep(0.2) # Small buffer to guarantee data has been written
        try:
            data = np.loadtxt(filepath)
            final_energy = data[-1]
        except Exception:
            final_energy = np.nan

        outspecs = sim_specs['out']
        output = np.zeros(1, dtype=outspecs)
        output['energy'][0] = final_energy

        return output, persis_info, calc_status

``calc_status`` will be displayed in the ``libE_stats.txt`` log file.

This completes our calling script and simulation function. Run libEnsemble with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python my_calling_script.py --comms local --nworkers 4

This may take about a minute to complete. Output should appear in a new
directory ``./ensemble``, with sub-directories labeled by ``sim_id`` and worker.

The following *optional* lines parse and display some output:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import os

    for dir in os.listdir('./ensemble'):
        with open(os.path.join('./ensemble', dir, 'out.txt')) as f:
            out = f.readlines()
        print(dir + ':')
        for line in out:
            print(line)
        print('-'*60)

Each of these example files can be found in the repository in `examples/tutorials/forces_with_executor`_.

This may also take some additional browsing of the docs to complete.

Write an alternative simulation function similar to above, but with the following differences:

 1. Submit the forces application to run across two nodes, also using hyperthreads
 2. Replace the ``while`` loop with the ``Executor.polling_loop()`` routine, polling once a second.

           task = exctr.submit(app_name='forces', num_procs=cores, app_args=args,
                               stdout='out.txt', stderr='err.txt', wait_on_start=True,
                               num_nodes=2, hyperthreads=True)

           exctr.polling_loop(task, timeout=time_limit, delay=1)

           ...

Executor Variants
-----------------

libEnsemble features two variants of its executor that perform identical
functions, but are designed for running on different systems. For most uses,
the MPI variant will be satisfactory. However, some systems, such as ALCF's Theta
do not support MPI launches from compute nodes. On these systems libEnsemble is
run either on launch nodes or uses a proxy launch mechanism to submit
tasks from compute nodes. One such mechanism is a scheduling utility called
Balsam_ which runs on a separate node. The Balsam Executor variant interacts
with Balsam for this purpose. The only user-facing difference between the two is
which executor is imported and called within a calling script.
