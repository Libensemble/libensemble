Understanding libEnsemble
=========================

Overview
~~~~~~~~
.. begin_overview_rst_tag

libEnsemble is a Python library for coordinating dynamic ensembles
of calculations in parallel. libEnsemble uses a manager process to allocate work to
multiple worker processes. A libEnsemble worker is the smallest indivisible unit
that can perform calculations. libEnsemble's work is governed by three routines,
collectively known as **user functions**:

* :ref:`gen_f<api_gen_f>`: Generates inputs to ``sim_f``
* :ref:`sim_f<api_sim_f>`: Evaluates a simulation or other evaluation based on output from ``gen_f``
* :ref:`alloc_f<api_alloc_f>`: Decides whether ``sim_f`` or ``gen_f`` should be
  called (and with what input/resources) as workers become available

Example ``gen_f``, ``sim_f``, ``alloc_f``, and calling scripts can be found in
the ``examples/`` directory. In order to enable portability, an :doc:`executor<executor/overview>`
interface is supplied for users to execute and monitor external applications in their
user-provided ``gen_f`` and ``sim_f`` routines.

The default ``alloc_f`` tells each available worker to call ``sim_f`` with the
highest priority unit of work from ``gen_f``. If a worker is idle and there is
no ``gen_f`` output to give, the worker is told to call ``gen_f``.

libEnsemble uses a NumPy structured array known as the :ref:`history array<funcguides-history>`
to keep a record of all simulations. The global history array is stored on the
manager, while selected rows and fields of this array are passed to and from user functions.

Example Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. begin_usecases_rst_tag

Below are some expected libEnsemble use cases that we support (or are working
to support) and plan to have examples of:

* A user wants to optimize a simulation calculation. The simulation may
  already be using parallel resources but not a large fraction of some
  computer. libEnsemble can coordinate the concurrent evaluation of the
  simulation ``sim_f`` at various parameter values based on candidate parameter
  values from ``gen_f`` (possibly after each ``sim_f`` output).

* A user has a ``gen_f`` that produces meshes for a
  ``sim_f``. Given the ``sim_f`` output, the ``gen_f`` can refine a mesh or
  produce a new mesh. libEnsemble can ensure that the calculated meshes can be
  used by multiple simulations without requiring movement of data.

* A user wants to evaluate a simulation ``sim_f`` with different sets of
  parameters, each drawn from a set of possible values. Some parameter values
  are known to cause the simulation to fail. libEnsemble can stop
  unresponsive evaluations and recover computational resources for future
  evaluations. The ``gen_f`` can possibly update the sampling after discovering
  regions where evaluations of ``sim_f`` fail.

* A user has a simulation ``sim_f`` that requires calculating multiple
  expensive quantities, some of which depend on other quantities. The ``sim_f``
  can observe intermediate quantities in order to stop related calculations and
  preempt future calculations associated with poor parameter values.

* A user has a ``sim_f`` with multiple fidelities, with the higher-fidelity
  evaluations requiring more computational resources, and a
  ``gen_f``/``alloc_f`` that decides which parameters should be evaluated and
  at what fidelity level. libEnsemble can coordinate these evaluations without
  requiring the user to know parallel programming.

* A user wishes to identify multiple local optima for a ``sim_f``. Furthermore,
  sensitivity analysis is desired at each identified optimum. libEnsemble can
  use the points from the APOSMM ``gen_f`` to identify optima; and after a
  point is ruled to be an optimum, a different ``gen_f`` can produce a
  collection of parameters necessary for sensitivity analysis of ``sim_f``.

Combinations of these use cases are supported as well. An example of
such a combination is using libEnsemble to solve an optimization problem that
relies on simulations that fail frequently.

Glossary
~~~~~~~~

Here we define some terms used throughout libEnsemble's code and documentation.
Although many of these terms seem straight-forward, defining such terms assists
with keeping confusion to a minimum when communicating about libEnsemble and
its capabilities.

* **Manager**: Single libEnsemble process facilitating communication between
  other processes. Within libEnsemble, the *Manager* process configures and
  passes work to and from the workers.

* **Worker**: libEnsemble processes responsible for performing units of work,
  which may include submitting or executing tasks. *Worker* processes run
  generation and simulation routines, submit additional tasks for execution,
  and return results to the manager.

* **Calling Script**: libEnsemble is typically imported, parameterized, and
  initiated in a single Python file referred to as a *calling script*. ``sim_f``
  and ``gen_f`` functions are also commonly configured and parameterized here.

* **User function**: A generator, simulator, or allocation function. These
  are python functions that govern the libEnsemble workflow. They
  must conform to the libEnsemble API for each respective user function, but otherwise can
  be created or modified by the user. libEnsemble comes with many examples of
  each type of user function.

* **Executor**: The executor can be used within user functions to provide a
  simple, portable interface for running and managing user tasks (applications).
  There are multiple executors including the ``MPIExecutor`` and ``BalsamExecutor``.
  The base ``Executor`` class allows local sub-processing of serial tasks.

* **Submit**: Enqueue or indicate that one or more jobs or tasks needs to be
  launched. When using the libEnsemble Executor, a *submitted* task is executed
  immediately or queued for execution.

* **Tasks**: Sub-processes or independent units of work. Workers perform
  *tasks* as directed by the manager; tasks may include submitting external
  programs for execution using the Executor.

* **Persistent**: Typically, a worker communicates with the manager
  before and after initiating a user ``gen_f`` or ``sim_f`` calculation. However, user
  functions may also be constructed to communicate directly with the manager,
  for example, in order to efficiently maintain and update data structures instead of
  communicating them between manager and worker. These calculations
  and the workers assigned to them are referred to as *persistent*.

* **Resource Manager** libEnsemble has a built-in resource manager that can detect
  (or be provided with) a set of resources (e.g., a node-list). Resources are
  divided up amongst workers (using *resource sets*), and can be dynamically
  reassigned.

* **Resource Set**: The smallest unit of resources that can be assigned (and
  dynamically reassigned) to workers. By default it is the provisioned resources
  divided by the number of workers (excluding any workers given in the
  ``zero_resource_workers`` libE_specs option). However, it can also be set
  directly by the ``num_resource_sets`` libE_specs option.

* **Slot**: The ``resource sets`` enumerated on a node (starting with zero). If
  a resource set has more than one node, then each node is considered to have slot
  zero.
